# Introduction to Terra
***A Best Left Buried hack for playing Degenesis***

This hacked system is focused on playing **Degenesis** on the chassis of **Best Left Buried**. A few reference documents are required to play, as this system is not intended to be self-contained. These are all free to download.

- Setting: **Degenesis Rebirth Primal Punk (DPP)** and **Degenesis Rebirth KatharSys (DKS)**
- Chassis: **Best Left Buried Zine Edition** (**BLB**)
- Infections: **Metamorphica Revised (MMR)**

# Character creation
***Reference: Best Left Buried Zine 1***

PCs have three **Stats**: **Brawl**, **Wit** and **Will**. The rules are the same as **BLB**, except the starting values.

**Stats** values can be assigned in any distribution respecting:  
- Sum of all starting **Stats** is `1`
- Each **Stat** is between `-2` and `+2`

PCs also have two resource pools: **Vigour** and **Grip**. For Degenesis, **Grip** will be used a a measure of how far a PC is from becoming infected by Sepsis.

# Character archetypes
***Reference: Degenesis Rebirth Katharsys***

PCs have a Culture (their land), a Cult (their group) and a Concept, instead of **BLB** backgrounds. These are described in **DKS** and should be used narratively to define characters.

The mechanics implementation of character archetypes will follow the Everyman Archetype (**BLB** Zine 2). Choose one or two things your character is good at, and the same number for things they are bad at. Use the lists of Attribute and Skill bonus for Culture, Cult and Concept on **DKS** to get an idea on what characters with those backgrounds are good at, the rest they could be bad at.

# Advancements

Every time PCs accumulate 8 xp, they gain an advancement. Alongside an advancement, a PC also gains +1 Vigour and +1 Grip.

## General advancements

**Gain +1 in one chosen stat.**  
- Limit is +2 in the first 10 advancements
- Limit is +3 thereafter

**Gain the Upper Hand in one action type**
- Look at DKS skills for options 

**Gain one Rank on your Cult**
## Cult-specific advancements

### Spitalians

**Splaying** (DKS 49)
- Spend 1 Grip to gain +1 armour for one round. This advancement can be used as many times as desired in the same round, granting a higher armour modifier.

**Phalanx** (DKS 49)
- When enemies **Gang Up** on the character, negate the first two instances of the **Upper Hand**.
# Rules
***Reference: Best Left Buried Zine 4***

The resolution mechanics of BLB are used, when not stated differently. For general stat checks, the target number is **reduced from 9+ to 8+**. For combat, basic armour number is **reduced from 8 to 7**.

**Vigour recovery**
- Base rate of one recovered **Vigour** per day.
- It a PC does not have appropriate shelter, food or water, recovery is not possible.
- If someone is treating the PC, one additional Vigour is recovered per day upon a successful **Will** check. The check is **Against The Odds** it there are no appropriate supplies and equipment.

# Consequences
***Reference: Best Left Buried Zine 5 and Metamorphica Revised***

Gaining consequences work the same way the do on **BLB**. Unlike in **BLB**, afflictions will be used to expose Sepsis infestation - as opposed to character flaws and insanity.

To define what is the gained infestation, roll 1d200 and consult **MMR** 146-147.
