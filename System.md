This hacked system is focused on playing **Degenesis** on the chassis of **Best Left Buried**. A few reference documents are required to play, as this system is not intended to be self-contained. These are all free to download, and will be refereed to when necessary.

# Character creation

## Attributes (passive)
**Source: Best Left Buried**

PCs have three passive **Attributes**: **Fortitude**, **Reflexes** and **Willpower**. These attributes are used to define resource pool stats and for saving throws in the game. They are **not** added to skill rolls.

- **Fortitude**: represents the PC's physical prowess and toughness. Related to resistance to **Injuries**.
- **Reflexes**: represents the PC's gut brain reflexes. Related to avoiding **Injuries**.
- **Willpower**: represents the PC's intellect and resolve. Related to resilience to **Afflictions**.

**Attributes** start at -1, and the player can distribute 5 points in total, respecting a maximum of 2 on any **Attribute**.

## Resource pools
**Source: Best Left Buried**

PCs also have two resource pools: **Vigour** and **Stability**.

- **Vigour** is, effectively, hit points (to be better written later). Its maximum is **5** + character **Advancement** + **Hard**. This can be recovered at the rate of 1/day.
- **Savvy** is the ability to keep focused and acting decisively. It's maximum is **5** + character **Advancement** + **Edge**. This can be recovered at the rate of 1/day.
- **Grip** is the distance from being lost in madness, corruption, inhumanity. It's starting value is **5** + **Will**. This can only be recovered by taking **Injuries** or **Afflictions**.

## Skills (active)
**Source: Cities Without Number**

The following generic set of broad skills is a suggestion.

- List of 20 skills to be added. Contexts are: violence, exploration, social, survival and vocational.

The GM can change them if needed, respecting a few mathematical rules:

- The sum of the total skill values divided by the number of skills should be between $1/3$ and $2/3$.
- This proportion gives an average success rate (when rolling 2d6) of about 50%.
- This gives the average effect roll the value of 1.75 (since half of them will be used to beat the target value of 8+)
- When spending advancements to improve skills, the awarded skill points should be, roughly 1/6 of the total number of skills.

# Unified mechanics

- The Player describes the action and agrees with the GM what **Skill** is relevant for the roll. The Player decides if the PC is focusing on the success or on the effect.
- The GM defines the resistance (i.e. soak, d2 to d20) and level (i.e. progress clock) for the challenge.
- $3d6$ are rolled from the PC side, and a challenge die is rolled.
- The Player can pair any number of their dice to beat 8+, while the remainder die (or dice) defines the effect of the roll. The skill value is applied either to the success or to the effect - decided beforehand by the player.
- The effect is subtracted from the Resistance die for the result.
- A positive result subtracts that value from the level of the challenge. A negative result subtracts that value from the PCs Vigour, Savvy or Grip, depending on the action.

# Challenges
## NPCs as challenges

- NPCs have 3 attributes, just like PCs: Hard, Edge and Grip.
- Their Level is equal to the sum of the 3 attributes.
- Their Resistance die equals the die with twice as many sizes as the attribute.
- They don't, however, have three separate resource pools.
- A single resource pool (progress clock) is tracked, and it's value is 5 + Level.
- Once the progress clock is depleted, the NPC is defeated - with swords or tongs or both.

## World as challenges

- Unlike NPC, challenges from the world do not have attributes.
- A resistance die is defined by the GM. This should reflect the risk of the challenge.
- The progress clock is as big as the challenge is long. This is related to the length of the challenge, not it's risk.
