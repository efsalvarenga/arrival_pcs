# Introduction to Terra
***A Best Left Buried hack for playing Degenesis***

This hacked system is focused on playing **Degenesis** on the chassis of **Best Left Buried**. A few reference documents are required to play, as this system is not intended to be self-contained. These are all free to download.

- Setting: **Degenesis Rebirth** (**DEG**)
- Chassis: **Best Left Buried Zine Edition** (**BLB**)
- Skills: **Cities Without Number SRD** (**CWN**)

# Character creation

## Attributes (passive)
***Reference: Best Left Buried Zine 1***

PCs have three passive **Attributes**: **Fortitude**, **Reflexes** and **Willpower**. These attributes are used to define resource pool stats and for saving throws in the game. They are **not** added to (active) skill rolls.

- **Fortitude**: represents the PC's physical prowess and toughness. Related to resistance to **Injuries**.
- **Reflexes**: represents the PC's gut brain reflexes. Related to avoiding **Injuries**.
- **Willpower**: represents the PC's intellect and resolve. Related to resilience to **Afflictions**.

**Attributes** start at **-1**, and the player can distribute **5** points in total, respecting a maximum of **+2** on any **Attribute**.

## Resource pools
***Reference: Best Left Buried Zine 1***

PCs also have two resource pools: **Vigour** and **Grip**.

- **Vigour** is, effectively, hit points (to be better written later). Its maximum is **5** + character **Advancements** + **Fortitude**. This can be recovered at the rate of 1/day.
- **Grip** is how far your character is from becoming infected. It's starting value is **4** + **Will**. This can only be recovered by taking **Injuries** or **Infections** (afflictions in **BLB**).

## Skills (active)
***Reference: Cities Without Number SRD***

The following generic set of broad skills is a suggestion. They are divided in 5 skill groups . Most of them are defined in **CWN**, and the ones which are not can be interpreted freeform.

- **Violence**: Brawl, Shoot, Melee, Exert
- **Exploration**: Notice, Sneak, Pilot, Navigate
- **Social**: Connect, Lead, Perform, Talk
- **Survival**: Forage, Craft, Treat, Tame
- **Vocational**: Administer, Program, Know, Trade

**Skills** start at **-1**, and players can distribute points on them, respecting a maximum of **+2** on any **Skill** during character creation.

- **Option 1**: Distribute 8d6 on the five skill groups and, after assigning the dice, rolls them to determine how many skill points to distribute on each skill group. Overflow points (if lucky) can be assigned to any skills, regardless of skill groups.
- **Option 2:** Alternatively, **DEG**'s 3Cs (Culture, Cult and Concept) suggests skill groups. Overflow points (if lucky) can be assigned to any skills, regardless of skill groups.
- **Option 3 (fast assignment)**: start every skill at 0, and distribute 2d6 + 1 skill points, regardless of skill groups.

# Unified resolution mechanics

Resolution mechanics from **BLB** work well with this hack by reducing the target number (**DC**) from 9+ to 8+ to reflect the lower average attribute/skill values. **PbtA** degrees of success (6-, 7-9, 10+) also work reasonably well. DC bands from **CWN** can also be used. The below is a suggestion of unified mechanics based on **BLB** combat resolution, expanded to all actions in the game.

1. **Player** describes the action and agrees with the GM what **Skill** is relevant for the roll.
2. **GM** defines the **DC** and the **Level** of the challenge
	1. **GM** might roll a challenge die from d2 (normal) to d12 (impossible) and add to 7 to determine the **DC**.
	2. **Level** of challenge varies from 1 (simple), 4 (complex) to 8 (daunting)
3. **Player** roll 3d6.
4. **Player** choose any combination of 2 dice + skill at use that beats the **DC**.
5. Remainder die is the **Effect**, that gets applied to the challenge **Level** of challenge.
	1. If the **Effect** die is a 6, **Player** might roll an additional 1d6 for increased **Effect**.
6. If the challenge Level is overcome, the challenge is overcome.
7. **Players** can choose more than one action to subdue a challenge, but every attempt until final success should have a cost or consequence.

In **Combat** situations, **Armour** defines the **DC**. Effect is deducted from NPCs' Vigour. And NPCs would have their own rounds, attacking back against PCs - i.e. GM rolls dice for NPCs in combat. In other skill applications, the Player rolling dice is sufficient to adjudicate consequences to both PCs and NPCs.

# Challenges (DC)
## NPCs as challenges

- NPCs have 3 attributes, just like PCs. These attributes are, however, also used actively.
- Their Level is equal to the sum of the 3 attributes.
- Their challenge die equals the die as many sizes as their attribute (scaled down).

## World as challenges

- Unlike NPC, challenges from the world do not have attributes.
- A resistance die is defined by the GM. This should reflect the risk of the challenge.
- The progress clock is as big as the challenge is long. This is related to the length of the challenge, not it's risk.


## Advancements


- When spending advancements to improve skills, the awarded skill points should be, roughly 1/6 of the total number of skills.
