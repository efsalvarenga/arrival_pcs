# Introduction to Terra
***A Best Left Buried hack for playing Degenesis***

This hacked system is focused on playing **Degenesis** on the chassis of **Best Left Buried**. A few reference documents are required to play, as this system is not intended to be self-contained. These are all free to download.

- Setting: **Degenesis Rebirth** (**DEG**)
- Chassis: **Best Left Buried Zine Edition** (**BLB**)
- Skills: **Cities Without Number SRD** (**CWN**)

# Character creation

## Attributes (passive)
***Reference: Best Left Buried Zine 1***

PCs have three passive **Attributes**: **Fortitude**, **Reflexes** and **Willpower**. These attributes are used to define resource pool stats and for saving throws in the game. They are **not** added to (active) skill rolls.

- **Fortitude**: represents the PC's physical prowess and toughness. Related to resistance to **Injuries**.
- **Reflexes**: represents the PC's gut brain reflexes. Related to avoiding **Injuries**.
- **Willpower**: represents the PC's intellect and resolve. Related to resilience to **Afflictions**.

**Attributes** start at **-1**, and the player can distribute **5** points in total, respecting a maximum of **+2** on any **Attribute**.

## Resource pools
***Reference: Best Left Buried Zine 1***

PCs also have two resource pools: **Vigour** and **Grip**.

- **Vigour** is, effectively, hit points (to be better written later). Its maximum is **5** + character **Advancements** + **Fortitude**. This can be recovered at the rate of 1/day.
- **Grip** is how far your character is from becoming infected. It's starting value is **4** + **Will**. This can only be recovered by taking **Injuries** or **Infections** (afflictions in **BLB**).

## Skills (active)
***Reference: Cities Without Number SRD***

The following generic set of broad skills is a suggestion. They are divided in 5 different contexts. Most of them are defined in CWN, and the ones which are not can be interpreted freeform.

- **Violence**: Brawl, Shoot, Melee, Exert
- **Exploration**: Notice, Sneak, Pilot, Navigate
- **Social**: Connect, Lead, Perform, Talk
- **Survival**: Forage, Craft, Treat, Tame
- **Vocational**: Administer, Program, Know, Trade

**Skills** start at **-1**, and players can distribute points on them, respecting a maximum of **+2** on any **Skill**.

- **DEG**'s 3Cs (Culture, Cult and Concept) define 15 points. More on this below.
- PCs choose 10 skills to increase one point.
- PCs choose 2 skills that are at +1 and move them to +2.

### 3Cs Skills



# Unified mechanics

Resolution mechanics from **BLB** work well with this hack by reducing the target number (**DC**) from 9+ to 8+ to reflect the lower average attribute/skill values. **PbtA** degrees of success (6-, 7-9, 10+) also work reasonably well. DC bands from **CWN** can also be used. The below is a suggestion of unified mechanics based on **BLB** combat resolution, expanded to all actions in the game.

1. **Player** describes the action and agrees with the GM what **Skill** is relevant for the roll.
2. **GM** defines the **DC** and the **Level** of the challenge
	1. **GM** might roll a challenge die from d2 (normal) to d12 (impossible) and add to 7 to determine the **DC**.
	2. **Level** of challenge varies from 1 (simple), 4 (complex) to 8 (daunting)
3. **Player** roll 3d6.
4. **Player** choose any combination of 2 dice + skill at use that beats the **DC**.
5. Remainder die is the **Effect**, that gets applied to the challenge **Level** of challenge.
	1. If the **Effect** die is a 6, **Player** might roll an additional 1d6 for increased **Effect**.
6. If the challenge Level is overcome, the challenge is overcome.
7. **Players** can choose more than one action to subdue a challenge, but every attempt until final success should have a cost or consequence.

In **Combat** situations, **Armour** defines the **DC**. Effect is deducted from NPCs' Vigour. And NPCs would have their own rounds, attacking back against PCs - i.e. GM rolls dice for NPCs in combat. In other skill applications, the Player rolling dice is sufficient to adjudicate consequences to both PCs and NPCs.

# Challenges
## NPCs as challenges

- NPCs have 3 attributes, just like PCs: Hard, Edge and Grip.
- Their Level is equal to the sum of the 3 attributes.
- Their Resistance die equals the die with twice as many sizes as the attribute.
- They don't, however, have three separate resource pools.
- A single resource pool (progress clock) is tracked, and it's value is 5 + Level.
- Once the progress clock is depleted, the NPC is defeated - with swords or tongs or both.

## World as challenges

- Unlike NPC, challenges from the world do not have attributes.
- A resistance die is defined by the GM. This should reflect the risk of the challenge.
- The progress clock is as big as the challenge is long. This is related to the length of the challenge, not it's risk.


## Advancements


- When spending advancements to improve skills, the awarded skill points should be, roughly 1/6 of the total number of skills.
