# Introduction to Terra
***A Best Left Buried hack for playing Degenesis***

This hacked system is focused on playing **Degenesis** on the chassis of **Best Left Buried**. A few reference documents are required to play, as this system is not intended to be self-contained. These are all free to download.

- Setting: **Degenesis Rebirth** (DEG)
- Chassis: **Best Left Buried Zine Edition** (BLB)
- Skills: **Cities Without Number SRD** (CWN)

# Character creation

## Attributes (passive)
***Reference: Best Left Buried Zine 1***

PCs have three passive **Attributes**: **Fortitude**, **Reflexes** and **Willpower**. These attributes are used to define resource pool stats and for saving throws in the game. They are **not** added to (active) skill rolls.

- **Fortitude**: represents the PC's physical prowess and toughness. Related to resistance to **Injuries**.
- **Reflexes**: represents the PC's gut brain reflexes. Related to avoiding **Injuries**.
- **Willpower**: represents the PC's intellect and resolve. Related to resilience to **Afflictions**.

**Attributes** start at **-1**, and the player can distribute **5** points in total, respecting a maximum of **+2** on any **Attribute**.

## Resource pools
***Reference: Best Left Buried Zine 1***

PCs also have two resource pools: **Vigour** and **Grip**.

- **Vigour** is, effectively, hit points (to be better written later). Its maximum is **5** + character **Advancements** + **Fortitude**. This can be recovered at the rate of 1/day.
- **Grip** is how far your character is from becoming infected. It's starting value is **4** + **Will**. This can only be recovered by taking **Injuries** or **Infections** (afflictions in BLB).

## Skills (active)
***Reference: Cities Without Number SRD***

The following generic set of broad skills is a suggestion. They are divided in 5 different contexts. Most of them are defined in CWN, and the ones which are not can be interpreted freeform.

- **Violence**: Brawl, Shoot, Melee, Exert
- **Exploration**: Notice, Sneak, Pilot, Navigate
- **Social**: Connect, Lead, Perform, Talk
- **Survival**: Forage, Craft, Treat, Tame
- **Vocational**: Administer, Program, Know, Trade

**Skills** start at **-1**, and players can distribute points on them, respecting a maximum of **+2** on any **Skill**.

- DEG's Culture, Cult and Concept define 15 points
- PCs choose 10 skills to increase one point
- PCs choose 2 skills that are at +1 and move them to +2


# Unified mechanics

- The Player describes the action and agrees with the GM what **Skill** is relevant for the roll. The Player decides if the PC is focusing on the success or on the effect.
- The GM defines the resistance (i.e. soak, d2 to d20) and level (i.e. progress clock) for the challenge.
- $3d6$ are rolled from the PC side, and a challenge die is rolled.
- The Player can pair any number of their dice to beat 8+, while the remainder die (or dice) defines the effect of the roll. The skill value is applied either to the success or to the effect - decided beforehand by the player.
- The effect is subtracted from the Resistance die for the result.
- A positive result subtracts that value from the level of the challenge. A negative result subtracts that value from the PCs Vigour, Savvy or Grip, depending on the action.




# Challenges
## NPCs as challenges

- NPCs have 3 attributes, just like PCs: Hard, Edge and Grip.
- Their Level is equal to the sum of the 3 attributes.
- Their Resistance die equals the die with twice as many sizes as the attribute.
- They don't, however, have three separate resource pools.
- A single resource pool (progress clock) is tracked, and it's value is 5 + Level.
- Once the progress clock is depleted, the NPC is defeated - with swords or tongs or both.

## World as challenges

- Unlike NPC, challenges from the world do not have attributes.
- A resistance die is defined by the GM. This should reflect the risk of the challenge.
- The progress clock is as big as the challenge is long. This is related to the length of the challenge, not it's risk.


## Advancements


- When spending advancements to improve skills, the awarded skill points should be, roughly 1/6 of the total number of skills.
