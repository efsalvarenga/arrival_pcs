# Context

**Kult: Divinity Lost** ([video review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78jZImSiTgc)) is an RPG that explores themes of horror, mysticism, and the hidden truths of reality. It is known for its mature and often unsettling content, diving deep into psychological horror and existential dread.

## Themes

- **Hidden Realities**: The game posits that the world we see is an illusion, a veil that hides the true nature of reality from humanity. Players confront the horrifying truth that lies beyond this illusion, revealing a world much darker and more complex than they could imagine.
- **Divinity and Demonic Forces**: It explores the concept of divinity, gods, and demons in a unique manner, suggesting that divine beings and demonic entities play a significant role in the cosmos. These beings often have their own agendas, which can be both malevolent and benevolent, influencing or directly intervening in the human world.
- **Human Mind and Madness**: A significant aspect of the game is the exploration of the human psyche, delving into themes of madness, fear, and the breakdown of the self. Characters may grapple with their sanity as they face the horrors of the world, emphasising psychological horror.
- **Moral Ambiguity and Personal Horror**: Players are challenged with moral dilemmas and personal horror, forcing them to confront their characters' darkest aspects. It questions notions of good and evil, often placing characters in situations where moral choices are not clear-cut.
- **Control and Freedom**: It examines themes of control, freedom, and the fight against oppressive structures, both metaphysical and societal. Characters might struggle against fate, divine plans, or the machinations of powerful entities that seek to control the human race.

# System

`terra-v0.0.0`

**Best Left Buried** ([video review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3RFTmq4L1U)) emphasises a minimalist rule system designed to foster atmospheric horror and survival tension, prioritising player skill and strategic resource management over character abilities. The game stands out for its focus on the psychological impact of uncanny consequences, where the true enemy is often the fear and madness that comes from uncovering things that are, perhaps, **Best Left Buried**.

## Rules
***Reference: Best Left Buried Zine 4***

The resolution mechanics of **BLB** is used, when not stated differently.

Target numbers (**TN**) for non-combat checks are changed, to align with the PbtA framework:  
- **6- Failure**: the GM makes a **move** against the PCs.
- **7-9 Minor success**: the GM takes a **hold** against the PCs.
- **10+ Major success**: the action succeed as planned.

Because **KDL**'s moves have a pace mechanic intrinsic to them, the **Tension Pool** will not be used.

**Vigour** recovery:  
- Base rate of one recovered **Vigour** per day.
- It a PC does not have appropriate shelter, food or water, recovery is not possible.
- If someone is treating the PC, one additional Vigour is recovered per day upon a successful **Will** check. The check is **Against The Odds** it there are no appropriate supplies or equipment.

Any action executed by a PC that has no reason to have ability with it, is rolled **Against The Odds**.
### Relations

As per **KDL** 135. Interpret **Grip** as Stability, and require a Will check in all 3 cases. **Grip** gain is only possible once per game month.

## Consequences
***Reference: Best Left Buried Zine 5***

Gaining consequences work the same way the do on **BLB**. For thematic coherence, **Afflictions** should be chosen from the list of **Disadvantages** from **KDL** 89.

For **Injuries**  
- **3 on d6**: For any **Attribute** Loss, roll a d10 and count **Attributes** from top-left to bottom-right
- **5 on d6**: For any penalty on checks, roll a d10 and count **Attributes** from top-left to bottom-right
