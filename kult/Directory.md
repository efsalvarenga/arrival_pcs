**Kult: Divinity Lost** is an RPG that explores themes of horror, mysticism, and the hidden truths of reality. It is known for its mature and often unsettling content, diving deep into psychological horror and existential dread.

## Themes

- **Hidden Realities**: The game posits that the world we see is an illusion, a veil that hides the true nature of reality from humanity. Players confront the horrifying truth that lies beyond this illusion, revealing a world much darker and more complex than they could imagine.
- **Divinity and Demonic Forces**: It explores the concept of divinity, gods, and demons in a unique manner, suggesting that divine beings and demonic entities play a significant role in the cosmos. These beings often have their own agendas, which can be both malevolent and benevolent, influencing or directly intervening in the human world.
- **Human Mind and Madness**: A significant aspect of the game is the exploration of the human psyche, delving into themes of madness, fear, and the breakdown of the self. Characters may grapple with their sanity as they face the horrors of the world, emphasising psychological horror.
- **Moral Ambiguity and Personal Horror**: **Kult: Divinity Lost** challenges players with moral dilemmas and personal horror, forcing them to confront their characters' darkest aspects. It questions notions of good and evil, often placing characters in situations where moral choices are not clear-cut.
- **Control and Freedom**: It critically examines themes of control, freedom, and the fight against oppressive structures, both metaphysical and societal. Characters might struggle against fate, divine plans, or the machinations of powerful entities that seek to control the human race.

# System: Best Left Buried

**Best Left Buried** emphasises a minimalist rule system designed to foster atmospheric horror and survival tension, prioritising player skill and strategic resource management over character abilities. The game stands out for its focus on the psychological impact of uncanny consequences, where the true enemy is often the fear and madness that comes from uncovering things that are, perhaps, **Best Left Buried**.

## Character creation

### Archetypes
***Reference: Kult Divinity Lost***

PCs have an archetype. Each archetype defines Dark Secrets, Disadvantages, Advantages, and Relations. Consult **KDL** for a description of each archetype.

### Stats
***Reference: Best Left Buried Zine 1***

PCs have three **Stats**: **Brawl**, **Wit** and **Will**. The rules are the same as **BLB**, except the starting values.

**Stats** values can be assigned in any distribution respecting:  
- Sum of all starting **Stats** is `2`
- Each **Stat** is between `-2` and `+2`

**Active attributes from KDL (Reason, Intuition, Perception, Coolness, Violence, Charisma, Soul)**
- Choose 2 attributes to be good at - **Stat** checks have **The Upper Hand** (**TUH**)
- Choose 3 attributes to be bad at - **Stat** checks are **Against The Odds** (**ATO**)
- The remaining 2 attributes are neither **TUH** nor **ATO**.

PCs have two resource pools: **Vigour** and **Grip**. These are fully detailed in **BLB**.

## Advancements

Every time PCs accumulate 8 **Experience**, they add a new **Advancement** and gain +1 **Vigour** and **Grip**.

For each of the first 5 **Advancements**, choose one:  
- Increase one **Stat** in +1 (up to +2)
- Gain +1 **TUH** in an Attribute
- Gain a new Advantage from your Archetype

For each of the **Advancements** between the 6th and the 10th, choose one:  
- Increase one **Stat** in +1 (one stat up to +3, the others up to +2)
- Gain +1 **TUH** in an Attribute
- Gain a new Advantage from any Archetype
- End your PC's story and start a new PC with 2 **Advancements**.

For each of the Advancements after the 10th, choose one:  
- Increase one **Stat** in +1 (one stat up to +4, the others up to +3)
- Gain +1 **TUH** in an Attribute
- Gain a new Advantage from any Archetype
- End your PC's story and start a new PC with 4 **Advancements**.
- Advance your character to an Enlightened Archetype.

# Rules
***Reference: Best Left Buried Zine 4***

The resolution mechanics of BLB are used, when not stated differently. For general stat checks, the target number is **reduced from 9+ to 8+**.

When **KDL** asks for a passive attribute check for Fortitude, Willpower or Reflexes, roll with the **Stats** **Brawl**, **Will** or **Wit** - respectively. When **KDL** asks for an active attribute check, roll a relevant **Stat** and use **the Upper Hand (TUH)** or **Against The Odds (ATO)**, if appropriate.

**Vigour recovery**
- Base rate of one recovered **Vigour** per day.
- It a PC does not have appropriate shelter, food or water, recovery is not possible.
- If someone is treating the PC, one additional Vigour is recovered per day upon a successful **Will** check. The check is **Against The Odds** it there are no appropriate supplies and equipment.

# Consequences
***Reference: Best Left Buried Zine 5 & Kult Divinity Lost***

Gaining consequences work the same way the do on **BLB**. For thematic coherence, afflictions should be chosen from the list of Disadvantages from **KDL** 89.
