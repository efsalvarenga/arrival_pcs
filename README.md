## Cosmology of Terra Campaigns

***Creation, and the Veil - before post classical age***

- The **Truth** exists, where the **Godbound** abode. The **Truth** is the unobserved, where everything is possible. Quantum mechanics, dreams, parallel realities are all facets of the **Truth**. **Humanity** was once **Godbound**.
- A **Godbound** known as the **Demiurge** ordered the creation of the **Veil**. The **Veil** blinded us, **Humanity**, from the **Truth** (kdl 189).
- **Malkuth** broke from the **Demiurge**'s plan, and weakened the **Veil.** Our Awakening started through technology development and erratic sorcery. 

***Post classical and modern ages campaigns***

- **Humanity**'s MES (Meta-dimensional Extroversion Syndrome) drove unprecedented technological capabilities, including the codification of psionic and sorcery.
- The Mandate AI found a breach in the **Veil**, and prepared the **Highshrine** to protect Humanity.
- The **Scream** in the **Veil** Nebula isolated the many worlds.



- On the ancient structures of the **Veil** and the remnants of the **Highshrine**, **Humanity** built the Legacy - a tapestry of laws that solidified **Humanity**'s control on our abode.
- In **Humanity**'s thirst for power, Sorcerer-Kings invaded the **Truth**, splintered and stole Celestial Engines to power their Made Gods.
- Without the Celestial Engines, the **Veil** faltered and the decadent **Legacy** deteriorated further. **Uncreation** started.
