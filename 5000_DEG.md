# Degenesis in Terran Engine {-}

This section details how to play **Degenesis** using a (slightly) modified version of the **Terran Engine v0.5.3a**.

The following links can be used as an introduction of the **Degenesis** setting:

- **Degenesis** Trailer [One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTCARC91yyw) and [Two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tw3KaMr8wk)
- [Dave Thaumavore's **Degenesis** Review](https://youtu.be/8aZRkjvtaow?si=EXGuFbe9oarAbIJ7)
- [**Degenesis** Navigable Map](https://degenesis.com/world/map/)

The **Terran Engine** is self contained in this section, and will not require reading the [SRD](https://efsalvarenga.github.io/terraSystem/) separately.

## Requirements {-}

- **Degenesis Rebirth**, which can be obtained at no cost from the [Degenesis website](https://degenesis.com/downloads/books/degenesis-rebirth-edition):
	- **Primal Punk** `DR1`
	- **Katharsys** `DR2`
- [The Metamorphica (Classic Edition)](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/pt/product/115703/The-Metamorphica-Classic-Edition), which can be acquired as pay-what-you-want `MORPH`
- **Light** and **Dark Dice**

## Characters {-}

1. With the other players, define a cohesive group concept.
2. Always start with a Name and *Archetype*.
3. Roll for *Attributes* and assign points.
4. Roll for *Grit* and *Ego.*
5. Choose one *Advancement.*

A character sheet is available [here](assets/TerranSheet.pdf).

### Archetypes {-}

You are defined by your **Culture**, **Clan** and **Concept**.
Together they define your *Archetype*.
The *Archetype* encapsulates your background, concept, role and community within the narrative.
It should offer an immediate grasp of your identity and behaviours.
It is expected you will evolve beyond your initial *Archetype*, towards unique narratives.
`DR2 34-41`

#### Example: Who is Scuff {-}

We will create **Scuff** as an example character.
Because the group is playing in the **Balkan** region, **Scuff** took that as a **Culture**.
The group also agreed to play as a scouting detachment, and most of them are **Clanners**, although one is a **Scraper** - but not **Scuff**.
**Scuff** is intended to be a believer in spirits, so their concept is that os a **Zealot**.

### Attributes and Saves {-}

There are $6$ *Attributes* that you can use to overcome obstacles.

- **Intuition**: track targets, understand creatures, care, survive.
- **Reason**: concentrate, think abstractly, build knowledge.
- **Finesse**: dextrous manipulation, precision, subtle misdirection.
- **Exertion**: apply physical force and power, melee.
- **Attunement**: get in the flow and tune the arcane or technology.
- **Influence**: compel obedience, socialise, influence.

Each *Attribute* has a rating (from $0$ to $4$) that determine how many dice to roll when performing *Risky Actions.*
On the character sheet, their ratings are read horizontally.

*Saves* are groupings of two *Attributes* each.

- **Insight/Evasion** *Save* groups **Intuition** and **Reason** *Attributes*
- **Prowess/Physical** *Save* groups **Finesse** and **Exertion** *Attributes*
- **Resolve/Mental** *Save* groups **Attunement** and **Influence** *Attributes*

*Saves* also have ratings (from $0$ to $2$) that determine how many dice to roll in a *Reaction* situation.
On the character sheet, their ratings are read vertically.

#### Determine ratings {-}

For each *Save* grouping (**Insight**, **Prowess**, and **Resolve**) roll $1d$ and consult the table below to determine how many rating points you have to distribute for each.

|               | $1:3$ | $4:5$ | $6$ |
| :------------ | :---: | :---: | :-: |
| Rating points |  $1$  |  $2$  | $3$ |

In certain conditions, you might permanently lose ratings, this is discussed in other sections.

#### Example: Scuff's ratings {-}

![](https://i.imgur.com/bnKfumi.png)


Scuff has an **Attunement** *Attribute* rating of $3$ (read horizontally).
They roll $3d$ when performing a Risky Action related to **Attunement**.
They also have **Influence** $0$ (horizontally), so they roll $0d$ (i.e. no chance if no advantage is found).
If their **Resolve** is challenged, they may roll a *Reaction* with $1d$, based on their **Resolve/Mental** *Save* rating (read vertically).

### Grit & Ego {-}

> *"It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward"*
> (Rocky Balboa)

While *Grit* represents your physical disposition, *Ego* represents your resilience.

Roll $1d$ to determine your initial *Grit* maximum and initial *Ego.*
Advancements and conditions may change these numbers.

After a well fed and rested night, you recover $1d$ of *Grit* lost.
You may choose to consume **Primer** spores (or drugs based on these spores) and roll $1d$ to reset your *Ego.*
You can keep the new value if it is higher than your current *Ego*.

#### Wounds {-}

You lose *Grit* when you are physically harmed. 
When your *Grit* reaches $0$ you become *Mortally Wounded* and will die if harmed.

While *Mortally Wounded* you cannot gather *Light Die* for your *Risky Actions*.
You will die in minutes if not attended to.

If you survive a *Mortal Wound*, you develop a malaise.
Roll $1d$ and consult the table below.
With the GM, describe it narratively.
A malaise never recovers.

|     | Malaises                                                                           |
| :-: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $1$ | No malaise.                                                                        |
| $2$ | $-1$ **Prowess**, you die if it goes below $0d$.                                   |
| $3$ | $-1$ **Insight**, you die if it goes below $0d$.                                   |
| $4$ | $-1$ **Resolve**, you die if it goes below $0d$.                                   |
| $5$ | When you re-roll your *Ego,* use $-1d$ from now on. You die if it goes below $0d$. |
| $6$ | Re-roll your *Grit* with $-1d$ from now on. You die if it goes below $0d$.         |

Anytime you are harmed, you can choose to gain a *Wound* instead of losing *Grit*.
You have $3$ *Wound* tracks: Stressed ($-1d$ **Insight**), Broken ($-1d$ **Prowess**) and Weary ($-1d$ **Resolve**).
Each *Wound* track recovers through appropriate care and a week of rest.

#### Pushing yourself {-}

You spend *Ego* when you push beyond yourself in *Risky Actions* or use some character *Advancements.*
When your *Ego* reaches $0$ you are lost somehow.
With the GM determine how your last scene goes.

#### Example: Scuff's scuffs {-}

![](https://i.imgur.com/IYdZoZh.png)


The character above has $1d$ for both *Grit* and *Ego* (usual for early characters).
They have seen some harm, having lost $3$ *Ego* (from $5$ to $2$) and taken a **Hazed** wound.
This means that any time they roll related to **Insight** (**Intuition** or **Reason** for *Risky Actions*, or **Evasion** *Reaction*), they take $-1d$.

This character has also risked their *Ego* a few times, and took **Spores** to reset it.
They have taken a mutation, which is detailed as a *Condition*.
Finally, they have got a malaise at some point, having reduced their **Exertion** *Attribute* rating because of a weak lower back.

### Advancements {-}

As you become more seasoned, you gain *Advancements*.
You start the game with $1$ *Advancement*.
Many *Advancements* in this section are adaptations of **Degenesis**' Potentials.
These will be accompanied by book reference tags.

For every session you play (and survive) you gain $+2$ *Experience*.
You also gain $+1$ *Experience* for each new *Condition* you develop.

Whenever it is narratively coherent, you may spend *Experience* equal to $2\times$ your current number of *Advancements* to gain a new one.
Until you have $5$ *Advancements*, you can only choose from your own **Cult** or from the common list.
As you do that, you may reset your *Grit* maximum.
Roll your dice and keep the maximum between the current and the new *Grit*.

### Conditions {-}

Ignore the *Conditions* provided in **Terran Engine**'s SRD.
*Ego* is re-rolled when consuming Primer spores, slowly mutating you.
Spores can be consumed directly from nature, or through drugs.
Every time you consume spores, make a *Risky Action* with $0d$ (you may choose to risk *Ego*, as usual).
If your *Ego* did not reach $0$, re-roll it and take the higher value.

|       | Outcome                                                                  |

|  $6$  | *Condition*: Roll a beneficial mutation. `MORPH`                         |

Whenever your new *Ego* is lower than the current number of *Conditions*, you gain an Stigmata.
