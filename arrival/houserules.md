# Rules adopted for Arrival

## Rest

As proposed on Gritty Realism (DMG267):
- Short rests (so that you can heal a number of hit dices) changes from 1h to 8h.
- Long rests (so that you can fully recover HP and hit dices) changes from 8h to 7 days. 
- Elven trance is half of the short/long rest.

## Damage and Injury

- On a critical hit, the target makes a CON saving throw. In case of failure, a lingering injury is set. As proposed on Injuries (DMG272).

## Life expectancy

- Elves live up to 3000 years. Some even longer - and there are tales that in the past elves were actually immortal (like on LotR).
- All other races are maintained.

## Characters' death (or retirement)

- If a character dies, or if the player decides to retire their character, a new character will be built with half the average level of the rest of the party (always rounded down to the lowest integer, i.e.: floor of number).

## Hit points when leveling

- Characters gain the standard hit points as shown on the PHB + CON modifier.

## Sanity and madness

*Exposure to the occult leaves mundane creatures vulnerable to stimuli, sense perceptions, and revelations that their minds were never meant to perceive. The knowledge is like an infection. It burrows, it burns, and it consumes. Recognising the strange angles of a damnable creature’s wings reveals to the hero a whole new panorama of inhuman shapes and horrific vistas, such that she might suffer uncontrollable fits of panic when confronted with some mundane object that just happens to echo those hideous arcs. A human mind is forced open and compelled to receive impressions that more blessedly ignorant souls need never confront. The best that most sufferers can do is to create a firebreak around the idea, a zone of scorched reason to serve as a buffer against the awareness. This takes the shape of a Delirium, a focused insanity that allows them to rationalise or reject an insight. This lessens the grip of Madness and gives them some respite from its pains.*

**Sanity score**

The full sanity score is set as the **maximum between Intelligence and Wisdom, multiplied by 5 - respecting a minimum of 50 and maximum of 90**. The current sanity score, at all times, will fluctuate being equal or less the full sanity score. **If the current score ever reaches 0 the character is hopelessly lost** in their own tormented perceptions and can no longer function as a player character.

**Sanity checks, and loosing sanity**

**Once per scene, the GM might require PCs to make a sanity check. That is done with a d100 roll under the current sanity score. On a failure the PC looses sanity score as per table below.** The sanity check might be triggered by bloodshed, deep eldritch and alien events. A mind has a limit to the amount of insanity it can incur in a single event. After a certain point the senses numb and no further horror can be experienced. In a single scene, a character can lose no more sanity score than the (non cumulative) maximum result of the worst shock they confront.

| Event type | Cost | Examples                                                                                                                   |
| ---------- | ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bloodshed  | 1d4  | Shell-shock from battle or explosions, including magical                                                                   |
| Bloodshed  | 2d4  | Torturing or being tortured<br />Experiencing death or maiment of a friend                                                 |
| Bloodshed  | 2d6  | Becoming maimed or disfigured<br />Hurting an innocent on purpose                                                          |
| Bloodshed  | 2d8  | Finding a gruesome scene                                                                                                   |
| Bloodshed  | 2d10 | Witnessing the death of a party member in a gruesome or horrific manner                                                    |
| Eldritch   | 1d4  | Studying the works of a lunatic                                                                                            |
| Eldritch   | 2d4  | Reading text from an eldritch language<br />Encountering a gargantuan-sized beast or monster                               |
| Eldritch   | 2d6  | Move between realities<br />Realising you have a modified memory<br />Being haunted or encountering a mind-bending monster |
| Eldritch   | 2d8  | Hearing an eldritch entity speak<br />Discovering forbidden or ancient arcane knowledge                                    |
| Eldritch   | 2d10 | Experiencing a major supernatural situation                                                                                |

**Deliria, and recovering sanity**

*While the Delirium can be burdensome, it shelters them from the worst of their suffering. Too many Deliria can prove ruinous, however, as each additional Delirium increases the risk of a cascade of failing defences and exposure to unendurable realisations. The higher the edifice of madness is built, the more likely it is to fall.*

**Players might choose to accept a Delirium** for their characters to recover sanity score. After gaining a new Delirium, the PC must advance a level before accruing any more; the mind’s flexibility is limited. The player can choose what delirium they get (see material below) or roll randomly in a chosen table. It is easier to choose the new Delirium in-between sessions, and discuss the roleplay and mechanical results with the GM.

**Deliria examples (non comprehensive)**
- 5e's long term of indefinite madness [tables](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/madness)
- 3.5e SRD variant indefinite insanity [table 6-11](https://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/campaigns/sanity.htm)
- Ravenloft's [dark gifts](https://5e.tools/book.html#vrgr,1,dark%20gift%20descriptions,0)
- Call of Cthulhu's [phobias and manias](https://cthulhuwiki.chaosium.com/rules/sanity.html#sample-phobias-and-manias)
- Silent Legions' [sample deliria](https://i.imgur.com/pHGjaC1.png)

After taking the Delirum the player **rolls 1d20; if the roll is equal or greater than their total number of Deliria then the newfound structure and rationalisation soothes their mind**, recovering 10 points of sanity. If the roll is less than their total number of Deliria, then the fresh insanity just makes everything worse, and 10 points of sanity are lost. Once accrued, Deliria can never be lost.

Some Deliria come with phobias and compulsions. A PC can resist the phobia or compulsion by making a successful Sanity Check. On a failure, he or she must obey the Delirium unless they are willing to lose 1d6 sanity points for defying the structure they have fashioned to protect their sanity.

Alternatively, sanity can be recovered slowly, and under care of calming therapies. **PCs recover 1 sanity score per long rest, if they are able to rest in a complete calm environment, with friends or professionals to attend to them, and talk to them**. When PCs are accruing levels, **they also recover sanity score at the rate of 1 plus the best of the PC's INT and WIS modifiers**.

## Learning new languages

As there will be many languages in Guemenos, we need to expand a bit the rule of learning languages from the PHB (https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/adventuring#Training). We will use as follows:
- **Dissimilar languages** (i.e. languages from different cultures that do not share a close culture lineage | 2+ links): Takes 4 quarters minus the intelligence modifier in quarters (minimum 1). Any racial language will be considered a dissimilar language.
- **Similar languages** (i.e. languages from different cultures that share a close culture lineage | 1 link): Takes 6 months minus the intelligence modifier in months (minimum 1). 
- **Dialects and official languages** (i.e. languages from the same culture or official language for the region you are): Takes 8 weeks minus the intelligence modifier in weeks (minimum 1).

Learning a language can be accomplished either by being immersed in a new language (free learning time and money -wise), or by having a tutor (8h/day, 1gp/day - downtime activity). 

## Skill usage

I've separated application of skills in 4 types: physical, perceptive, social and knowledge. There is probably some edge cases, but I think these four covers most of it. Each skill might be applied in one of more way as well - we decide on the table. This is not standard rule, but will help me come up with a system for applying skill checks (DMs will see that D&D leaves a lot undecided there).

- **Physical**: only used when actively doing something. Players have to describe intention and approach. Passive checks (reflexes) are done using saving throws. E.g.: Acrobatics, Athletics, Sleigh of hand, Stealth, Tool proficiencies.
- **Perceptive**: are always **on** passively, against which DCs are checked. Players can actively choose to use them as well - which will call for a dice roll (unless DC is impossible). Intention and approach must be described by the player for using the skill actively. E.g.: Animal handling, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Survival
- **Social**: are always **on** passively, against which DCs are checked. If a passive check is not enough to succeed, the GM might call for a roll (unless DC is impossible). Intention and approach will be assumed by the GM when using passively (i.e. it is expected sometimes the GM will assume them wrongly). This assumption by the GM is a trade-off tool we will use to avoid going off-character often ([more detail on social skills](https://tabletopjoab.com/how-and-when-to-use-dd-social-skills/)). E.g.: Deception, Intimidation, Performance, Persuasion.
- **Knowledge**: in general are always **on** passively (i.e. all the time the GM describes something a PC recognises). The players can also ask questions with regards the knowledge of their character any time - which will trigger a dice roll (unless it is clearly a success or impossible). Knowledge skills can also be used in long active actions, which requires description of intention and approach (i.e. research, rationalising about something the PC has experienced, documenting findings, etc). E.g., but not only, Arcana, History, Religion, sometimes Medicine, Animal Handling, Tools (even acrobatics could be checked this way, from a knowledge perspective).

N.B. 1: For rules on scores for passive checks refer to PHB175.
N.B. 2: During combat, using any skill is an action (also somewhere in the PHB).

## Combat actions

1. We run initiative, we track initiative and AC on the table (a player helps the GM)
2. At the beginning of each turn the GM briefly describes the scene as it stands (tokens are used sparingly as they reduce the speed of combat - theatre of the mind is the default)
3. Players are responsible to prepare for their round (players don't need to pay full attention to other players actions - just get a jist of it - as this simulates better a real combat). Players that are not ready to describe their character's action almost imediatly (up to 10 seconds for next session, 2 seconds less per session until we reach 2 seconds, and then 1 second) will have their round pushed to the end of the turn - and if indecision is not solved by the end of the turn, they automatically take a dodge action.
4. Players declare what they do, roll and compare with AC themselves, and describe the outcome (can be brief, but made dramatic on criticals). Damage is run.
5. GM describe the actions of all NPCs
6. Sometimes between rounds, on the same turn, the GM will need to update the scene (when something big changes, e.g. an area effect, someone falling, etc)

## Godbound Epic Characters
***Modified rules for Godbound to play Epic campaigns (useful for flashbacks on history, dreams, etc.).***

These rules pair PC levels to FWN Ranks (first entry).

**PCs**
Use most of Godbound rules, with a the below changes:
- Damage done by Godbound PCs is always read **straight** to foes. If any PC power mentions **straight** damage roll as if it is a critical hit (twice the dice, once the modifiers). Like in default Godbound, damage is taken directly from foes HD (which is HP / 4, as opposed to just HD - see below description for Foes).
- Godbound PCs HD is calculated as default.
- Attack modifier is `3 x Godbound PC level + modifiers`.
- Armour AC is inverted, and rules as per default Godbound rules (i.e. Dex modifier can be stacked up any Armour, but Armour give penalties to saves).
- Facts as default Godbound is optional, if 5e (+4 modifier for proficient) or WWN (use +2 for proficient) skills is easier for players, use that.
- Saves are inverted, as `6 + Level + Modifiers`
- Effort and Gifts as per default Godbound (initial 2 and 6, respectively).
- When levelling up, PCs get:
	- Increased attack bonus in +3
	- HD increased in `+4 + (CON Modifier) / 2`
	- Effort +1
	- Saves +1
	- New skill / fact
	- Gifts +2

**Foes**
Use the FWN stats, with the below changes:
- When a damage does not have a Godbound specific description, GM rolls damage and divide result by 4.
- Foes HP are calculated as normal (with different dice depending on size), and then divided by 4 to get the Godbound HD.


## Travel rules

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cZzxZZwYov4Z_T8UHeJHB8tGnhpnQRnauK7LTtzUe5k/edit

## Environment conditions

### Thunderstorm

- Visibility: The combined effects of precipitation and wind reduce visibility by three quarters, imposing a -8 penalty on Spot, Search, and Listen checks.
- Ranged attacks: Thunderstorms make ranged weapon attacks impossible, except for those using siege weapons, which suffer a -4 penalty on attack rolls.
- Light: Thunderstorms automatically extinguish candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. They cause protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and have a 50% chance to extinguish these lights.
- Wind:
	- Creatures must succeed on a DC 15 Fort save or be blown away (Tiny or smaller creatures; knocked prone and rolled 1d4 x 10 feet, taking 1d4 points of non-lethal damage per 10 feet), knocked down (Small; prone), or checked (Medium; unable to move forward against the force of the wind).
	- Airborne creatures are instead blown back 2d6 x 10 feet and dealt 2d6 points of non-lethal damage due to battering and buffeting (Small or smaller creatures), blown back 1d6 x 10 feet (Medium), or blown back 1d6 x 5 feet (Large).
- In addition, thunderstorms are accompanied by lightning that can pose a hazard to characters without proper shelter (especially those in metal armour). As a rule of thumb, assume one bolt per minute for a 1-hour period at the centre of the storm. Each bolt causes electricity damage equal to 1d10, DC 15 DEX ST reduces to half. 
- An unprotected character in cold weather must make a **Fortitude save each hour (DC 15, + 1 per previous check) or take 1d6 points of non-lethal damage**. A character who has the Survival skill may receive a bonus on her saving throw and may be able to apply this bonus to other characters as well.
- A character who takes any non-lethal damage from cold or exposure is beset by frostbite or hypothermia (treat her as fatigued). These penalties end when the character recovers the non-lethal damage she took from the cold and exposure.
- Non-lethal damage from cold or exposure cannot be recovered until the character gets out of the cold and warms up again. Once a character is rendered unconscious through the accumulation of non-lethal damage, the cold and exposure begins to deal lethal damage at the same rate.
