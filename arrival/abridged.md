***Arrival: A tale of wretched heroes in a broken world***

# Part 1 A kiss from the dark

## Chapter 1 No options outside

A group of strangers, who had all arrived in Watheton for different reasons, found themselves in the local tavern, sharing drinks and stories. There was Guilf, a rugged bard with a quick wit; Miraak, an outcast dragonborn soldier; Kethra a young sorcerer with a mysterious past; Fuko a drow wizard from the Ghost Domain; and Dolman, a brave dwarven scout eager to prove himself. As they chatted, they heard of a large-scale attack of golden dragons in the south, causing widespread panic and chaos. The city of Watheton had no choice but to organise a mass evacuation to the nearby [Tolfoddund mines](realms.md#Tolfonddundhesm).

The group quickly offered to assist the Watheton leaders in ensuring safe passage for the inhabitants of the city. They scouted the road to the mines, fending off attacks from dangers along the way. Upon reaching the mines, the group discovered that their journey was far from over. A former friend of Guilf, Nilperto, had been turned into an undead creature, with a strange tattoo on his neck. The group fought bravely against Nilperto and his minions, eventually defeating them and uncovering a hidden passage that led to the Intermine and further to the Nargun Mines.

## Chapter 2 The Glasrath alliance

As the group emerged from the Intermine, they found themselves on the outskirts of the [Nargun](realms.md#Nargunhesm) stronghold. The dwarves, who had been battling undead attackers for years, welcomed them with open arms. Over the next few weeks, many other people came to the mines seeking protection. Populations and armies from the cities to the south of Watheton, as well as drows from the Ghost Domain, arrived seeking shelter.

Some of the refugees from the cities had actually seen the dragons, offering a varied description of their appearance and abilities. Some said they had never seen anything like them before, while others claimed they had fought dragons in the past, but never ones as these. As tensions rose, the leaders of the various groups appointed the group of five as their representatives. They were tasked with forming an alliance amongst all the armies in order to stand a chance against the approaching horde of undead. 

In the midst of this chaos, the group met Ghuse, a martial cleric from [Algath](religions.md#Algath), the goddess of life and death. As they worked to unite the disparate forces, the group learned more about the strange tattoo on Nilperto's neck. They discovered that it was a mark of the undead army, a sign of their allegiance to a powerful necromancer who was rumoured to be behind the attacks.

With the clock ticking down and the undead army approaching, the group worked tirelessly to coordinate the defences of the mines. They organised the various armies into a cohesive unit, using their unique skills and talents to prepare and equip them for battle. They knew that the battle ahead would be brutal and bloody, but they also knew that they had a chance to turn the tide and protect the innocent people under their care.

## Chapter 3 Battle from Ammuinoth

The Glasrath Alliance now faces a horde of undead marching from the [Ammuinoth](realms.md#Ammuinoth). The battle starts, and three clashes happen in the mines. Miraak is killed, but was lucky enough to be close to Ghuse who starts a long ritual to resurrect him. Fuko also falls in battle, but she is unlucky to sink in the lake, only to be found too late. In the end, the alliance is victorious, but not without many casualties - including the wyrmling gold dragon that was freed by the Glasrath Defenders (the name given to Miraak, Guilf, Kethra, Dolman, and the now deceased Fuko). Access to the city of Khatdzig is established again. The group is celebrated as heroes, and their names are forever etched in the history of these mines. They have faced insurmountable odds and emerged victorious, proving that even in the darkest of times, there is still hope.

## Chapter 4 Going to Holzander
***3877.4E, spring***

A new party member joins the Glasrath Defenders - a dust elf cleric of [Mystra](religions.md#Mystra). With the goal of investigating the disappearance of the Gaelire Beikae, the Shield of Beauty, and her Paragon Force - which supposedly came to the Holzander burnt castle 10 years ago - the Glasrath Defenders went into the [Ammuinoth](realms.md#Ammuinoth). In the Castle of Bells they've met Weldon, a very pleasant werebear and then, in the Ardismouth Temple, they fought Tekerluth (who told them she was pregnant from Miraak). Due to combat injuries they decided to look for an exit towards the desert again. The Defenders reached Mystra's temple in the north desert, where they learned of other forces in play. One of them is a strange and powerful power within the Holzander castle. A second one is the religious and military organisation known as the Faithful Faletist Knights of the Arch (FFKA), which burned the Holzander castle 110 years ago, and apparently have some influence on the cities on the surface in the region.

## Chapter 5 A breath from the desert
***3877.5A, summer***

The Glasrath Defenders marched through the desolate landscape of Ammuinoth, their path illuminated only by the dim light of the Ghost Domain. As they approached the Holzander castle, they encountered a Ghost Rider, a cursed creature never before seen in the mortal. The Defenders clashed with the beast, their weapons and spells piercing its ethereal form.

After a brief rest to recover from their wounds, the group pressed on towards the castle. The sight that greeted them was one of destruction and decay. The walls had crumbled and the once-proud turrets were mere ruins. Strange feathery creatures seem to have taken lair in the broken battlements, but none were there while the Defenders entered.

As they searched for a way inside, they discovered a hole in the underkeep that led to the castle's subterranean depths. The group cautiously descended the rickety wooden staircase, the air thick with the stench of bird droppings and decay. At the bottom of the stairs, they stood at the entrance to a dimly-lit chamber. With weapons at the ready, they stepped forward into the unknown, prepared to face whatever terrors awaited them in the depths of the ruined castle.

## Chapter 6 The torturer of Holzander
***3877.5B, summer***

The Glasrath Defenders entered the first level of Holzander's castle, and saw psychotic scenes of torture and death. They met the responsible for them - a torturer known as the Gaoler - who threw in disturbing comments about having tortured Gaelira and killed the Paragon Force. The defenders decided it was too much of it and went on to kill the Gaoler - who had support from animated torture equipment and zombies. The battle that followed was challenging and some of the defenders were significantly hit. Especially Miraak who, during combat, realised he was not really brought back to life by Ghuse, but has been reanimated as an intelligent undead.

After killing the Gaoler, the defenders continued exploring the rooms and found two prisoners and their detainer, an ogre called Scar. The prisoners were Dugan Lovay - a dust elf merchant from the Linhe cities -, her companion, the Red Heart, and a halfling scholar from the capital Throta (in the northwest), who has been researching a disease known as the Lady Scurvy. The disease is some kind of death lycanthropy, but with very different consequences, that started afflicting the region about a year ago.

Scar, the ogre, did not pose a threat to the defenders, and was very relieved that the Gaoler was finally dead. While talking with the prisoners, the group became aware of a magic Mystra's door, through the catacombs, that goes into the surface (probably the lost access to the castle), and that the Gaoler knew the password to open it. Amyria also knows that this password is available in a book in Mystra's temple's library.

In this first level, several monuments existed: a frog statue of a long lost deity, a bowman statue, representing Cauchurn in the death river, and a memorial to the first Holzander, who established the castle, and explored the Brezal Paths that are so rich in the area. The group then decided to venture towards the catacombs, where they met Ushulx, a cultist of Cauchurn. Ushulx partnered with them while they fought shadows coming from the catacombs to the east and south. Everyone was too hurt to continue after, and the party decided to rest in the cells, together with the prisoners and Ushulx, while Scar kept a look for them.

## Chapter 7 The Void claim
***3877.5B, summer***

After a much-needed rest, the defenders huddled together in a dimly lit cell, sharing their knowledge and plans. Amidst the whispers, Ushulx, Durgan, Red Hart, and Ichbon discussed the animosity between Algath and [Curcharn](religions.md#Curcharn), two deities from the Deadecho. They also revealed the presence of other formidable residents in the castle, such as Cagoth-ze, a master of time magic, Danaska, an expert in oozes, and the powerful beings Imortra and Gellert. Ushulx expressed her eagerness to locate Avrindt, the Creep, a red dragon rumoured to have transformed into a death dragon. Meanwhile, Ichbon shared his quest to find a long-lost elven library that may hold knowledge about the Lady Scurvy disease.

The party engaged in a spirited debate about their next move, eventually deciding to venture to the lower level in search of Cagoth-ze. As they explored the second level, they stumbled upon records detailing gruesome ooze experiments and encountered a dangerous trap in the form of a green ink-ooze. Just moments later, Amirya's sharp eyes spotted something extraordinary—a time tributary, a river of time flowing through one of the rooms. In a bold and impulsive act, Guilf stepped forward and crossed the tributary, only to fall unconscious and undergo a magical transformation, becoming significantly younger. It became apparent that Guilf had been claimed by The Void, bound to a contract with this mysterious entity.

As the party deliberated their next steps, they noticed a clockwork servant skulking around the rooms, raising concerns about their safety. Acting swiftly, the group retreated from the second level and sought refuge in the safety of the cells on the first level, strategising their approach and considering the implications of Guilf's newfound contract with [The Void](religions.md#Ethux'zhurh).

## Chapter 8 First sight of Lady Scurvy
***3877.5B3, summer***

With their strength waning and their wounds still fresh, the band of weary heroes embarked on a treacherous journey towards the revered temple of Mystra, their priorities aligned with rejuvenation and restoration. As they traversed the Ammuinoth, their footsteps weighed heavily while caring their wounded. It was during this perilous expedition that their eyes fell upon a grotesque sight—a creature, contorted and abominable, crawling with malevolence along the ceiling. Ichbon recognised the fiendish being as an unfortunate victim infected by the accursed Lady Scurvy disease. Miraak, ever vigilant, discerned disturbing similarities between the creature's combat tactics and the vile vampire spawns employed by the armies of D'Elsin during the savage southern war. A battle ensued, arduous and fraught with peril, but it culminated in a final, decisive blow dealt by Kethra.

Days later, they reached the temple and met an old acquaintance of Amyria's, Jandar from the Desolate Flats, who informed them of undead ravaging Linhe. The FFKA, stalwart guardians of this strategic territory, had valiantly stood against the encroaching darkness. He was astonished as he discovered that the presumed fallen Glasrath Defenders still clung to life, offering their aid to the beleaguered region.

Rested, they headed to Gimorkoc, facing a rare thunderstorm. The storm, as abruptly as it had materialised, eventually receded. A Rurkinar ritual, an esoteric ceremony seldom witnessed, was poised to commence, orchestrated by the cultists' enigmatic high shaman. Their aim? To establish communion with the Angel Hound, a being of enigmatic power and purpose. Yet, amidst the gathering darkness and whispered incantations, Guilf, beset by a profound sense of disquiet, caught sight of a face within the throng—a visage hauntingly familiar, the countenance of his long-lost mother. Driven by an irresistible force, he chased after her, his companions hot on his heels.

![](https://i.imgur.com/XQExAKj.png)

## Chapter 9 The Rurkinar ritual
**3877.5F6, summer**

The valiant champions pursued Guilf's enigmatic mother. Yet, as they delved deeper into the unfathomable abyss of her powers, their fortitude waned, and their resolute spirits trembled. Guilf's mother possessed an indomitable mastery of Theurgy, a formidable force that unleashed abominations that sent shivers crawling along their spines, freezing their very souls.

Reluctantly, the group retraced their steps to the central square, drenched in a torrential downpour and an ethereal glow emanating from the ancient temple stones. The ritual to commune with the dreaded Angel Hound was underway. The air grew thick with anticipation as the incantations surged and chaos erupted, a violent upheaval that seized the cultists with ferocious might, wrenching them away to the somber castle ward under the merciless grip of the FFKA.

Undeterred by the dark turn of events, the heroes, cloaked in the veils of night, ventured into the shadowed heart of the castle ward. It was Guilf, his heart filled with courage and empathy, who dared to breach the psychic barriers of the Rurkinar Shaman. The long-awaited culmination of the ritual revealed the prison that ensnared the Angel Hound - the enigmatic Holzander Castle. The Shaman's arduous work had reached its fateful conclusion.

With the dawning of the morrow came the arrival of General Sergarus—a figurehead both dreaded and revered in Linhe. It was Sergarus who extended his impenetrable hand, granting clemency to the cultists detained in the night's embrace, save for the Shaman. In a damning judgment of treason, the Shaman was sentenced to the ghastly fate of impalement. Two hours later, under the watchful gaze of the village, the order was carried out by an FFKA knight with merciless precision.

## Chapter 10 Desert road
***3877.6A6, autumn***

The party became aware that the Faithful Faletist Knights of the Arch (FFKA) marked them as a group consisting of two adults, two children, and one old brute - an unconventional combination that added an air of mystery to their reputation.  As the heroes delved deeper into the mysteries of the land, they discovered that the thunderstorms in the region of Linhe had grown increasingly frequent and perilous. Prayers to Rurkinar, the Brown Eagle god, had fallen upon deaf ears, leaving the land vulnerable to the raging storms that now wreaked havoc upon the countryside. This disquieting revelation hinted at a growing imbalance in the forces that governed the realm.

Undeterred by these challenges, the group forged ahead, deciding to make their way towards Eyaram, where they would assess their options for reaching the Holzander castle from the desert. However, their plans took an unexpected turn when a scout arrived from the east, bearing troubling news. Another horde of undead had launched an attack on the countryside, specifically targeting the lands east of Eyaram. A detachment of the FFKA was dispatched to gather more information, while their commander, Sergarus, remained stationed in Gimorkoc.

The journey towards Eyaram commenced, and for the first two days, the group's path remained uneventful, save for the peculiar sight of ancient organic structures that hinted at a forgotten past predating recorded history. On the third day, they found themselves navigating a treacherous gorge, realising that descending into its depths would render them vulnerable to unseen dangers. Opting for a safer route around the cliff, fate interceded in the form of a solitary figure - a protector of the road and an outcast of the Nurderad dragonborn known as Gulthas Morseth.

Gulthas bore a burdened past, having been a participant in the raid of the mines under the influence of the battlemage Grezar. Near death's door, Gulthas uncovered the true nature of his tormentor - a shadow dragon in disguise. The revelation struck a chord with Amyria, who recognised the description of the shadow dragon from ancient lore. These creatures had long dwelled deep within the Earth, slumbering for ages. They had departed from the material world, received by Algath's blessings, only to return with nefarious intentions.

Parting ways with Gulthas, the group continued their journey towards the ruined Temple of Remains. There, they engaged in skirmishes with weakened undead adversaries, their collective strength proving superior in combat. Kethra's devastating power nearly laid waste to the entire ruin, but amid the chaos, a discovery awaited them—a tight, cold, and ominously glowing dark red tunnel that seemed to descend into the depths, perhaps leading to the enigmatic Ophaire. Amyria, channeling the divine might of her goddess Mystra, unleashed a wave of holy energy that obliterated seven undead creatures with a mere sight. The potency of her connection to Mystra became evident, further solidifying her status as a beacon of divine power within the group.

As they navigated the Temple of Remains, they unraveled its past purpose - a prison once held captive Algath, the goddess of death herself. The remnants of the ancient power that had resided within its walls left a haunting imprint, a reminder of the forces that once shaped the land. With caution and wisdom, the party decided to explore other areas of the ruined temple, aware that each step took them deeper into the heart of darkness that permeated the land. Uncertainty loomed over them, but their resilience and determination remained unwavering as they braced themselves for the secrets yet to be unveiled within the Temple of Remains.

## Chapter 11 Aivridyt's past
***3877.6B4, autumn***

In the grim depths of the Temple of Remains, the group of broken heroes came to a startling realisation - the tumultuous skirmish they had ignited upon their arrival had awoken other malevolent entities that lurked within the ancient halls dedicated to the death goddess.  No sooner had the group taken a defensive stance than they found themselves cornered by two Blessed Dead Adepts, abominations that wielded an unholy mastery over the forces of death. These dark necromancers were accompanied by their grotesque minions, the slave husks—twisted, pitiful figures bound to their malevolent will. The direst of all was the zombie clot, a monstrous amalgamation of hundreds of decaying bodies, writhing and pulsating with an insatiable hunger for flesh. Desperation filled the air as the group fought fiercely against their relentless adversaries. In the midst of the chaotic battle, Kethra, once again facing the clutches of death, found herself almost consumed by the ravenous corpses. Salvation came in the form of Guilf, whose quick thinking conjured a shroud of magical darkness, enveloping the battlefield and granting Kethra a slim chance of escape.

The following day, they took a moment to gather themselves and explored the remaining recesses of the ruined temple. Amidst the hundreds of tombs that lined the halls, their eyes fell upon four imposing statues and a tome written in the ancient draconic script. Two of the statues bore a chilling familiarity - Ghuse and Grezar, names that resonated with historical significance. However, the inscriptions on the statues hinted at a disquieting revelation - the beings masquerading as Ghuse and Grezar were mere facades, vessels assumed by none other than Aivridyt herself, carrying out her sinister machinations. The depths of her treachery were only beginning to reveal themselves.

Leaving the temple behind, the group continued their arduous journey along the desert road. Soon, they encountered a sight both awe-inspiring and foreboding: a towering, ancient metal statue. Filled with a childlike curiosity, Guilf, unable to resist its allure, decided to perch within the statue's mouth, immediately succumbing to a reverie that transcended mortal understanding. He found himself in communion with Mondendovil, the Ngar'tho Void - an ancient deity of the depths.

Mondendovil spoke of the colossal statue as his long-lost physical form, and conveyed a chilling prophecy - the time for his return drew near. His devoted servants would soon arrive to reconnect his powerful mind with his formidable body, a union that would reshape the very fabric of existence. The implications of this encounter sent shivers coursing through the group's spines, stirring a profound urgency within their hearts.

Reluctantly leaving the enigmatic statue behind, the group pressed on, their sense of purpose heightened. The road led them to the Dwarf enclave of Durnum, where they sought respite and replenishment, even as the weight of their impending destiny hung heavily upon their shoulders.

## *Dramatis Personae*: Aivridyt, the Creep
***Also known as: The Purple Evil, Ghuse, Grezar and other names***

In the shadowed annals of time, Aivridyt, once a small and ferocious female red dragon known as the Creep, ruled with a malevolence that sent shivers coursing through the Naragzah mountains. This fearsome creature, driven by a sinister curiosity, delved ever deeper into the labyrinthine caverns that lay beneath, venturing into the sacred mines of the two dwarven clans that called those depths their domain. The encounters with the Creep became a recurring nightmare for the Tolfoddund and Nargun warriors, who suffered greatly at her wrathful claws. It was in the year 3856 NC, amidst the blood-soaked peaks of the mountains, that an alliance was forged between the battered clans. United, they struck a grievous blow, leaving Aivridyt wounded and retreating into the dark recesses below.

Humbled and wounded, the Creep sought solace in the unfathomable depths of the Ghost Domain. For six long years, she slumbered, her formidable essence cocooned in the embrace of darkness. Unbeknownst to her, during her deep slumber, a passage opened, beckoning her to the eerie realm known as the Dead Echo. Aivridyt was ensnared by its tendrils, and when she awoke, her once-vibrant scales had transmuted into a twisted shadow red, its hues akin to that of viscous petroleum, intertwined with accents of haunting purple. The Creep had become the Purple Evil—a creature steeped in darkness and corruption.

To her dismay, the Purple Evil discovered that she had come to bear eggs, a phenomenon unheard of in the annals of draconic lore for millennia. Her progeny's arrival was an unexpected twist of fate, and she laid the eggs in a cavernous lair, inadvertently attracting the attention of a destitute family dwelling perilously close to the mountains. Swift and merciless, the Purple Evil dispatched the parents, but she saw potential in the seven-year-old child, Kethra Stormwind. Cunningly, she donned the guise of a gentle sage, veiling her true nature beneath a veneer of wisdom and compassion. Kethra was ensnared in a perpetual state of drowsiness, ensorcelled by the Purple Evil's potent magic and elixirs, deceived into believing she was raised by the sage in her humble abode. The Purple Evil harboured no clear plans for the child, and her careless machinations led to an unforeseen turn of events. Kethra, awakening from her prolonged stupor, escaped the clutches of the lair, leaving behind the twisted enchantments that had held her captive.

In her insatiable hunger for power, Aivridyt, assuming the guise of Ghuse, a human guard captain and cleric devoted to Algath, the goddess of life and death, plotted her ascent in the city of Gorthugke. From the shadows, she manipulated her way to the pinnacle of military command, her influence spreading like a dark stain across the region. In tandem, she concocted a macabre alliance with Grezar, a necromancer dwelling among the dragonborn of Nurderad. The nefarious Grezar orchestrated a vengeful assault upon the Tolfoddund dwarves, reaping havoc upon their land—a cruel act of retribution for the Creep's past transgressions. It was also Grezar that, years before, sent Miraak much too young to battle, where his body and soul burned, becoming a faint memory of a once fearless dragonborn warrior.

## *Interlude*: A dream of Makab

In the depths of their wearied minds, some of the Glasrath defenders share a nightmare, one that plagued their restless slumber. This nightmarish vision transported them to an ancient temple shrouded in the mists of the sea - a place of forgotten rituals and unspeakable horrors.

Within the dream, they found themselves thrust into the midst of a sinister ceremony, their presence intended to thwart the unfolding ritual. Yet, as the dream progressed, a chilling realisation dawned upon them - the Glasrath defenders themselves were integral to the very ritual they sought to disrupt. Their every action, their every step, was predetermined, inexorably woven into this malevolent enchantment.

Enigmatic beings, known as Ngar'thos, stood as mere witnesses, their forms twisted and alien, indifferent to the mortals' plight. And at the centre of it all stood the Eldritch Furnace, a conduit to realms unimaginable, where Ethux'zhurh, an embodiment of The Void, awaited its unwitting prey.

As the dream neared its crescendo, Kimbarak, driven by desperation and armed with a golden dagger, believed it to be his salvation - a weapon that could sever the grasp of The Void and restore balance. But the cruel irony of the nightmare unfolded before their eyes. As Kimbarak raised the dagger, it was not The Void that was halted, but Kimbarak himself who became ensnared within the swirling tapestry of reality, forever condemned to serve as a slave spirit to the ancient horrors that lurked beyond.

With despair gnawing at their hearts, the remaining defenders made a fateful decision - to flee the accursed temple and escape the clutches of Ethux'zhurh. Their footsteps echoed through the corridors and inhumane rooms, a desperate bid for survival. Yet, Guilf's dream diverged from the others, his nightmare ending with a chilling embrace by The Void itself, an all-encompassing darkness that dragged him relentlessly into the unfathomable depths of the sea. Miraculously, the surviving defenders, in a stroke of sheer luck, managed to sail away from the awakening Ethux'zhurh, evading its wrath and preserving their tenuous hold on existence.

## Chapter 12 Finding Holzander once more

In the shadowed enclave of Durnum, the broken Glasrath defenders sought refuge among the stoic dwarves, their journey fraught with despair and uncertainty. Amyria, ever the beacon of compassion, extended a benevolent hand to the famine-stricken dwarves. Her words promised respite from the relentless Dust Elf traders who, under the merciless rule of Neeleu, demanded burdensome tributes. As the heroes conversed with Glorizerlug Chaosfoot, the dwarven elder revealed the secrets of Durnum's origins. The mining enclave had been hewn from the very bedrock of an ancient construction shaft, a subterranean passageway that linked to the tunnels of Ammuinoth.

From the lips of Chaosfoot, they learned of the grim state of affairs in the southern realms, a harrowing tale of defeat and despair that had driven the Kiranu dwarves to forsake their mountain abodes. Their desperate exodus northward had been shielded by the stalwart Nurderad Dragonborn, but the heroes' hearts grew heavy with dread. In the midst of their deliberations, Dolman's heart wrestled with a terrible choice. His Kirano kin, vulnerable and threatened, called out to him from the south. Yet, the enigmatic secrets of Holzander Castle where his mother has been lost a decade ago. A heavy silence hung over the party as they made their fateful decision to press onward to the castle, hearts heavy with the weight of unresolved choices.

It was Guilf, his mind forged in the fires of bardic curiosity, who delved into the thoughts of the dwarves. Through their collective memory, he gleaned the knowledge they sought—the hidden path to Holzander Castle, an invaluable revelation that saved them precious hours of fruitless searching in the unforgiving desert.

With resolve renewed, the broken heroes embarked on the desert trail, their passage serene until they reached the ancient ruins of Dannamore. Here, beneath a tumultuous thunderstorm that cast jagged forks of lightning across the heavens, they found themselves pursued by a vengeful storm spirit, a tempest incarnate. Within the crumbling confines of Dannamore's ruins, the weary travelers stumbled upon an unexpected encounter—a band of Anak Warriors, also fleeing the encroaching southern conflict. In a tragic twist of fate, Kethra, her instincts awry, launched a fateful assault upon the unsuspecting Anaks. The ensuing clash was fierce and sorrowful, and amidst the chaos, Miraak fell upon the cold stonefrom a grievous wound inflicted by a nimble Anak hidden in the ruins. In the end, the broken heroes emerged victorious, yet the taste of innocent blood upon their hands was a bitter and haunting reminder of their choices.

Amidst these tumultuous events, Guilf seized another chance to commune with The Void, an entity that loomed over him like a shadowy spectre. The revelation struck like a thunderbolt—Guilf's very soul had been pledged to this malevolent force, a debt owed by his own mother in a dark covenant of ages past.

Now, within the ominous embrace of Holzander Castle, the broken heroes stood at a crossroads of destiny, their past and future intertwined in the eldritch tapestry of fate.

## Chapter 13 The Ancient Elven Library

In the labyrinthine depths of Holzander Castle, the broken heroes found themselves enmeshed in a web of arcane intrigue. Danaska, the scholarly seeker of forbidden knowledge, had a request—a sinister task she desired accomplished. She wished for Cagoth-Ze, a master of time manipulation and a rival scholar, to be removed from the equation. The heroes, their spirits burdened by the enigma of the castle, were hesitant to oblige. Their path diverged, leading them to Cagoth-Ze's chamber, where they learned of the mage's own desire to eliminate Danaska. Once again, the group declined the call to violence.

Cagoth-Ze, however, was not to be deterred. The master of time offered an alternative proposal—an arrangement in which the group would eliminate the imprisoned Ngar'tho within the summoning circle. But the heroes, weary of treacherous bargains and the siren call of dark deeds, once more turned down the offer. Thus, they ventured into the presence of the imprisoned Ngar'tho, an ancient entity yearning for freedom. It sought nothing but release, offering valuable information in return for its emancipation.

In the end, the broken heroes struck a bargain with the Ngar'tho, a pact sealed with knowledge and secrets. The entity divulged the whereabouts of Galiera, held captive on the castle's elusive third level by the Blighted, a race ensnared by the malevolent Gellert. Furthermore, it unveiled the cryptic path to the hidden library, concealed within the tapestry of time itself.

With the Ngar'tho liberated, Cagoth-Ze believed the heroes had fulfilled their part of the bargain and welcomed them into his realm within the castle's second level. There, they encountered a time construct, a paradoxical creation that would transport them through the temporal currents to the fabled library.

The journey through the ever-shifting tides of time was a disorienting and surreal experience. The heroes glimpsed fleeting imprints of the world's past and future, each image a fleeting echo of reality, each moment pregnant with foreboding.

After hours spent within the library, delving into tomes of arcane wisdom and timeless mysteries, the heroes returned to their present time with the time construct. It was at this pivotal juncture that the group found itself divided, their destinies pulling them in disparate directions.

Dolman, Guilf, and Amyria were resolute in their quest to rescue Galiera from the clutches of the Blighted on the third level. Meanwhile, Miraak and Kethra, their hearts aflame with the burning desire for justice and retribution, chose to confront Ghuse, the dark puppeteer who had manipulated their fates. With heartfelt farewells and whispered hopes of reunification in the uncertain future, the heroes embarked on their divergent paths within the enigmatic depths of Holzander Castle.

## Chapter 14 & 15: The Deepfolk

In the shadowed depths of Holzander Castle, the Glasrath champions pressed forward into the foreboding third level, their path fraught with peril and uncertainty. Before they embarked on this treacherous journey, Cagoth-Ze, the time arcanist, bestowed upon them an unexpected gift—an ancient construct known as Brilhorte 3000. Cagoth-Ze explained that Brilhorte 3000 had been a steadfast guardian in his own trials and tribulations, a stalwart companion to guide them through the labyrinthine darkness of the castle. The heroes welcomed their new mechanical ally with gratitude and camaraderie, their party now augmented by this enigmatic presence.

With introductions exchanged and Brilhorte 3000 by their side, the champions descended the stairwell leading deeper into the abyss of the third level. The landing was shrouded in impenetrable darkness, an eerie silence clinging to the air, broken only by faint, disquieting footsteps that hinted at the presence of hidden horrors. Guilf, ever perceptive, caught sight of Deepfolk warriors through narrow arrow slits in a dimly lit corridor to the south. They were positioned strategically, ready to unleash their deadly arrows upon any intruders.

A sudden and treacherous turn of events revealed itself as Brilhorte, acting upon some capricious twist of fate, unwittingly triggered a trap. The south door creaked open, and a merciless iron gate descended behind the heroes, locking them in a perilous bottleneck. The Deepfolk warriors, trained to precision and armed with fearsome giant sword spiders, converged upon the heroes from all directions. Brilhorte, inexplicably, shifted into a dormant, inactive form—a twist of fate forewarned by Cagoth-Ze.

What ensued was a relentless and protracted battle, an unyielding clash of wills and steel. Amyria, Dolman, and Guilf fought valiantly, dispatching many of their adversaries, but the Deepfolk, their numbers vast and their tactics cunning, gradually drove the heroes into a dire predicament, cornering them at the entrance to the third level. In a desperate gambit, Guilf conceived a daring plan. He would approach the Deepfolk alone, with Amyria and Dolman concealed. He would declare himself to be Imortra's son and offer himself willingly. Miraculously, the audacious ploy succeeded, and Bjrnyar, the leader of the Deepfolk, agreed to take Guilf captive, instructing his comrades to hunt down and eliminate the other intruders.

Meanwhile, Amyria, Dolman, and the now reactivated Brilhorte prepared an ambush for the two Deepfolk warriors hot on their trail. In a swift and brutal skirmish, they felled their foes, ensuring that the pursuit ended in their favor. Guilf, despite being in Bjrnyar's grasp, managed to break free just moments before the Deepfolk were to hand him over to their comrades. Bjrnyar, determined not to let his quarry escape, commanded the Deepfolk Shaman unit to join the fray once more, while he pursued Guilf with relentless resolve. Brilhorte, once again dormant, lay inert.

The Glasrath champions, acting swiftly and decisively, fled from the approaching Deepfolk. Their efforts to evade their pursuers proved futile, as the Deepfolk detected their presence in the landing room, the very place where the Ngar'tho had been imprisoned. Another frantic and harrowing battle erupted, culminating in one of the Deepfolk warriors fleeing in terror. However, the situation escalated as the heavy Deepfolk Shaman unit ascended the stairs, their ominous march resonating with a cacophony of armoured boots against the stone steps.

Desperate to escape, the heroes sought refuge aboveground, arriving at the same level where they had last encountered Ushulx. What they beheld there was a scene of profound anguish—Scar, the ogre who had allied with them, lay sacrificed by Ushulx's cruel hands. In that heart-wrenching moment, the champions vowed to exact vengeance upon Ushulx when they crossed her path again. As they ventured back to the first level of the castle, they were met with a disconcerting sight—undead entities flickered in and out of reality, a haunting manifestation that defied the boundaries of the living and the dead.

Summoning their resolve, the heroes made a courageous decision—to return to the second level of the castle and investigate the Deepfolk unit they had left behind. There, they found Cagoth-Ze, coerced and threatened by Bjrnyar to serve as an informant for the Deepfolk, should the heroes dare to return. Yet, Bjrnyar had not anticipated Guilf's ability to communicate telepathically with Cagoth-Ze. The gnome mage revealed the positions of the Deepfolk within the library, granting the champions a strategic advantage.

With this newfound knowledge, Dolman, Amyria, and Guilf laid an ambush for Bjrnyar and his companions. In a swift and decisive strike, Dolman's Halberd cleaved through the Deepfolk war leader's armour with deadly precision, ending his life in a cataclysmic stroke. The remaining Deepfolk, still unaware of their impending doom, combed through the level in search of the heroes who had eluded them. Unbeknownst to them, the champions had already ascended to the surface, seeking refuge in the desolate Dannamore Hold.

Outside the castle, an ominous sight awaited them—a colossal umbilical of energy connected the fortress to the heavens, its ominous significance shrouded in darkness. On their journey to Eyaram, the heroes encountered a group of Mercian commoners who spoke of the prophecy of Ethux'zhurh's awakening, drawing many to Linhe. They described a dreadful spectacle—a gaping black fracture tearing through the heart of the desert.

Amyria, Dolman, and Guilf resolved to protect the commoners on their path to Eyaram. But as they neared their destination, the night bore witness to the chilling manifestation of the commoners' fears—an otherworldly fracture in reality, from which three reality-flickering spiders emerged, their presence heralding an imminent and indescribable terror.
