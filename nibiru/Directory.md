Stars Without Numbers (SWN) is an OSR system, which allows me to easily reskin a lot published materials since the 80s. Different than old school D&D, SWN has a much simpler class system, with most of the customisation done through background, foci (i.e. feats) and a robust skill system (based on classic Traveler - which is the skill system of the Hostile game too). For SWN I can easily convert any D&D adventure (any version, easier with up to 2e), and Call of Cthulhu (d100 systems) with some small work. Additional flavour from other games are always welcomed (OSR compatible preferred, but anything can be discussed): Any rule, class, foci, etc from any OSR game can be considered. [Sine Nomine](https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/publisher/3482/Sine-Nomine-Publishing) books are very easy to integrate with each other. I have a few of them if someone is interested.

## Character creation guidance

- Character creation on the SWN book, pages 3 to 25.
- Nós vamos, inicialmente, definir apenas atributos.
- O resto da criação de personagens vai acontecer por meio das memórias recuperadas.
- Classes available: warrior, expert or mix/adventurer
- Everyone starts at level 1 with max HP (reduces hp jump at first level).
- Character sheet: [fillable pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bM8pMgGjMKao6s-12BjnkQ9MzXhFJ8i2/view?usp=drivesdk), [Google sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19vw6EHrl_2-8BcHob2_bxvcpLnVbAHbW3StjrNEFoKg/edit#gid=1671565117) or [freebooter app](https://www.swnfreebooter.net/)
	- Mas acho que não vamos precisar de ficha no começo 
- Novos Vagabonds começam no level 1, com apenas atributos (da mesma forma que personagens iniciais).

## Character advancement

The GM announces level-ups.


## House rules

House rules will be defined as self-contained moves. Moves are resolution mechanics from Powered by the Apocalypse (PbtA) and Forged in the Dark (FitD) systems that allow the story to progress towards three different directions on every dice roll: complete success, success with consequences or failure.
