# Context
  
**Nibiru** ([video review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBACC2zOlj8)) is a science fiction RPG centred around amnesia and discovery, set in a massive space station known as Nibiru, which serves as a haven for forgotten memories. Players take on the roles of Vagabonds, individuals who have arrived in Nibiru with no memory of their past, and must explore the station and its bizarre societies to uncover their histories and the secrets of this enigmatic world.

## Themes

- **Memory**: The theme of memory is central, as characters struggle to piece together fragmented memories and uncover the truth about their pasts. Memory serves as both a tool and a barrier, shaping the characters' identities and driving their actions as they explore the mysteries of the Nibiru.
- **Identity**: In a world where characters' memories are unreliable and their true selves are often obscured, characters must navigate the complexities of identity, grappling with questions of who they are and who they want to become in the face of uncertainty and amnesia.
- **Exploration**: Characters' journey through the vast and enigmatic space station known as the Nibiru. As they do, they uncover hidden secrets, encounter strange creatures, and navigate treacherous environments as they explore the depths of the ship and search for answers about its origins and purpose.

# System

**Best Left Buried** ([video review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3RFTmq4L1U)) emphasises a minimalist rule system designed to foster atmospheric horror and survival tension, prioritising player skill and strategic resource management over character abilities. The game stands out for its focus on the psychological impact of uncanny consequences, where the true enemy is often the fear and madness that comes from uncovering things that are, perhaps, **Best Left Buried**.

## Character creation
***Reference: Best Left Buried Zine 1***

### Habitat

PCs têm um Habitat (**NBR** 127-147). Cada Habitat define regras específicas para a recuperação de Memórias e Revelações.

Archetypes e Advancements do **BLB** não vão ser usados diretamente, apenas como inspiração (mecânica) para as Revelações do **NBR**.
### Stats

Para a criação de personagens basta definir os atributos (**Brawl**, **Wit**, **Will**) e calcular **Vigour** e **Grip**.

PCs start with: `+2` in one stat, `+1` to another and `+0` to the last.

PCs have two resource pools: **Vigour** and **Grip**.
- Max **Vigour** is 6 + **Fortitude**
- Starting Grip is 4 + **Willpower**

## Advancements

Memory Points (**MP**) são concedidos:
- `+1` base point per session
- `+1` if your PC has faced a dangerous situation
- `+1` if your PC succeeded in 1+ **Grip** checks
- `+1` if your PC has raised or lowered one Relation
### Memos System
***Nibiru 112-113***

Cada nova memória custa **5 MP**. Memórias negativas concedem **5 MP** ao PC.

Memórias positivas concedem, na primeira ação relacionada à memória por cena, **The Upper Hand** para o **Stat** check. Por outro lado, memórias negativas concedem **Against The Odds** para o **Stat** check.
### Revelations
***Nibiru 115-119***

Ao acumular 8 Memórias, o PC ganha uma **Revelação**. Ao ganhar a **Revelação**, os PCs também ganham 1 **Vigour** e **Grip** (efetivamente esse é o Level Up do **Best Left Buried** hackeado com o **Nibiru**). Alternativamente, o jogador pode discutir com o GM e escolher um **Advancement** do **Best Left Buried**.

## Regras

The resolution mechanics of **BLB** is used, when not stated differently.

Os Influence Points do **NBR** serão substituídos pelo **Grip** do **BLB**.

**Vigour** recovery:  
- Base rate of one recovered **Vigour** per day.
- It a PC does not have appropriate shelter, food or water, recovery is not possible.
- If someone is treating the PC, one additional Vigour is recovered per day upon a successful **Will** check. The check is **Against The Odds** it there are no appropriate supplies or equipment.
### Relations

The player characters have Relation values to all other PCs, in addition to some of the more important NPCs they encounter. The PCs gain Relations with NPCs when established during character creation or during the course of the story.

Relation Strength:  
- **Neutral (0)**: Applies to most relations. Acquaintances, friends, coworkers, and others you don’t have much in common with.
- **Meaningful (1)**: Close friends, family members, romantic interests, beloved pets, personal mentor, guru.
- **Vital (2)**: Passionate lovers, your own children, the only friend you have left, your ‘true love,’ an obsession, your soulmate.

A Relation’s strength might be raised or lowered due to events occurring in play.

Implicações:  
- **Wish no harm**: If you intend on harming or killing your Relation, whether directly or indirectly, you must pass a **Will** check.
- **Regain Grip**: In a scene where you experience closeness, assurance, and affirmation from a Relation, you can make a **Will** check. If successful, your **Grip** is improved a number equal to the strength of the Relation value. This cannot be repeated again in the same game month.
- **Lose Grip**: If a Relation of yours is seriously injured, your must make a **Will** check. If unsuccessful, **Grip** is decreased a number equal to the strength of the Relation value. Double that number if the Relation dies.

### Combate

Distâncias:  
- **Close**: distância de melee. Reach significa que a arma ataca mesmo atrás de outra pessoa.
- **Near**: uma pequena sala.
- **Far**: mais de 20 metros.
- **Remote**: longe.

Ataques com distância menor ou maior que o Range de cada arma é feito **Against The Odds**.

## Consequences
***Reference: Best Left Buried Zine 5***

Gaining consequences work the same way the do on **BLB**. For thematic coherence, **Afflictions** might be chosen from the list of **Becoming Broken** from **NBR** 110.
