- **Opposed checks** should be used for most situations involving PCs vs. NPCs - i.e. NPCs' roll define DC. The GM might define that the minimum DC for some social situations is the NPC's morale score.
- **Unopposed checks** are used when a NPC is not the source of the DC for the ckeck. In this case, use the table below (which includes some conversion between Cepheus Engine and 5e to SWN.

| DC  | Description                                                                   | CE DM               | 5e DC |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ----- |
| N/A | The task is one the PC would normally perform as part of their background.    |                     |       |
| 6   | A simple challenge that's still enough to challenge a competent practitioner. | Routine (+2)        | 10    |
| 8   | A significant challenge to a competent professional.                          | Average (0)         | 15    |
| 10  | A challenge even a skilled expert might not manage to overcome.               | Difficult (-2)      | 20    |
| 12  | Only a true master could expect to overcome this challenge.                   | Very difficult (-4) | 25    |
| 14  | Only a true master has any chance of doing this at all.                       | Formidable (-6)     | 30    |

# Harm and violence

- Two types of a character's vitality: Physical and Mental
- **Physical vitality** is measured with HP (as disposition) and system strain.
- **Mental vitality** is measured with Grip and delirium.

## HP
***Disposition***

*HP can be thought of as a character's disposition to overcame harm - a combination of grit, luck, stamina, awareness of danger, energy and reflexes, and a generalised (and possibly desperate) determination to not be murdered.*

- Characters have their level in hit dice, as per SWN rules.
- Characters have their Constitution in system strain maximum.
- When a character rest for a full night, they recover their level in HP and one system strain

## Grip
***Humanity, Sanity and Willpower, based on [Silent Legion's Madness](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CexCpDNKNSMNnkGgDNrVne1gG-03L5dm&usp=drive_fs)***

*Bloodshed, exposure to horror and pushing oneself to accomplish feats humans would have failed can break havoc in the minds of mundane creatures, consuming their **Grip**. The best that most sufferers can do is to accept a **Delirium,** creating a zone of scorched reason to serve as a buffer against the awareness of the cruel and impossible.*

### Grip score

The **Grip** maximum score is set as the **average between Intelligence and Wisdom, multiplied by 5 - respecting a minimum of 50 and maximum of 90**. If the current **Grip** ever reaches 0 the character is hopelessly lost in their own tormented perceptions and can no longer function as a player character.

### Grip checks, and loosing grip

Once per scene, the GM might require PCs to make a **Grip** check: a d100 roll under the current **Grip** score. On a failure the PC looses **Grip** as per table below. The check might be triggered by bloodshed or horror events. Alternatively, the player can choose to expend 1d4 **Grip** to re-roll a failed attribute, skill, attack or saving throw check. In a single scene, a character can lose no more **Grip** score than the (non cumulative) maximum result of the worst shock they confront.

```
-----------------------------
   EXAMPLES OF GRIP COSTS  
-----------------------------

  1d4   Seing a human corpse for the first time
        Shell-shock from battle or explosions, including magical
        Studying the works of a lunatic
  1d6   Killing human beings not in immediate self-defense
        Witnessing a scene of gruesome slaughter
        Being affected by a hostile magic effect
        Witnessing a rarionally impossible event or object
        Witnessing a magical cult ritual
        Supress the immediate effects of a Delirium
  1d8   Suffering mutilation or torture
        Witnessing the violent death of a friend or close ally
        Abandoning living allies to cultists or otherwordly entities
        Learning of a horrible fate for a friend or close ally
        Reading text from an eldritch language
        Encountering a gargantuan-sized beast or monster
  2d6   Indirectly killing many people by action or omission
        Move between realities
        Realising you have a modified memory
        Being haunted or encountering a mind-bending monster
  2d8   Hearing an eldritch entity speak
        Discovering forbidden or ancient arcane knowledge
 2d10   Experiencing a major supernatural event

```

### Deliria, and recovering Grip

**Players might choose to accept a Delirium** for their characters to recover **Grip**. The player can choose what delirium they get (see material below) or roll randomly in a chosen table. It is easier to choose the new Delirium in-between sessions, and discuss the roleplay and mechanical results with the GM.

**Deliria examples and references (non comprehensive)**
- Madness from Nightmares Underneath 
- 5e's long term of indefinite madness [tables](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/madness)
- 3.5e SRD variant indefinite insanity [table 6-11](https://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/campaigns/sanity.htm)
- Call of Cthulhu's [phobias and manias](https://cthulhuwiki.chaosium.com/rules/sanity.html#sample-phobias-and-manias)
- Silent Legions' [sample deliria](https://i.imgur.com/pHGjaC1.png)
- Best Left Buried's [afflictions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gMvMcuhIFXWkvjqnP8e-XpcMVObmRVrY/view) (zine 5)

After taking the Delirum the player **rolls 1d20; if the roll is equal or greater than their total number of Deliria** then the newfound structure and rationalisation soothes their mind, **recovering 10 Grip**. If the roll is less than their total number of Deliria, then the fresh insanity just makes everything worse, and 10 points of sanity are lost. Once accrued, Deliria can never be lost.

Some Deliria come with phobias and compulsions. A PC can resist the phobia or compulsion by making a successful **Grip** Check. On a failure, he or she must obey the Delirium unless they are willing to lose 1d6 **Grip** for defying the structure they have fashioned.

# NPCs

## Statblocks

NPCs do not need to be balanced with characters, but the process below can help define relative balanced power levels for NPCs based on their hit dice (**HD**).

### HD and Attributes
***Inspired by Best Left Buried***

NPCs have **HD** and three attributes, **Brawl**, **Wit** and **Will**. **HD** can be interpreted as the NPC's version of levels. Attributes are abstraction of abilities, skills, characteristics and powers. They and are the main driver of further stats for social and combat mechanics.

- **Brawl**: represents the NPC's physical strength, endurance and vital force.
- **Wit**: represents the NPC's physical, mental and social agility.
- **Will**: represents the NPC's mind and willpower.

NPCs have `1 + HD` in total attribute points to be distributed between **Brawl**, **Wit** and **Will**. Attributes are added (or subtracted, when negative) to any checks where they are relevant.

### Derived Stats
***Inspired by 5e's DMG, Forge of Foes, AD&D, and the Without Number games***

Armour class **(AC)**: Effort is used as a modified [usage dice rule](https://nothingventured.obsidianportal.com/wikis/usage-dice) from Black Hack. But instead of decreasing the die, once a 1 or 2 is rolled, no more effort is available to the NPC.  Defined as `10 + Wit`, capped at 22. It is perfectly valid that an NPC has a suit of armour to increase its AC.

Hit points (**HP**): `HD * hit die` , with hit die defined by **Brawl** as below. For values in between, use the position on the left.

| Brawl score | - 3 | -1  | +1  | +3  | +5  | >+8 |
| ----------- |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Hit die** | d4  | d6  | d8  | d10 | d12 | d20 |

**Effort**: Defined by **Will** as below. For values in between, use the position on the left.

| Will score     | <0  | +1  | +2  | +3  | +4  |  +5  |  +6  | >+7  |
| -------------- |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| **Effort die** |  0  |  1  | 1d4 | 1d6 | 1d8 | 1d10 | 1d12 | 1d20 |

**Save** target: `15 - HD/6`

The table below depicts generic values of derived stats from HD 0 to 20.

|  hd |  hp | effort |  ac | save | att | totdmg | shock | Î£ stats |
| ---:| ---:| ------:| ---:| ----:| ---:| ------:| -----:| -------:|

### NPC resolution rules
***Inspired by Nightmares Underneath, and the Without Number games***

**Saving throws** are rolled with a d20, applying the **appropriate attribute** as modifier, against the target defined as **Save** on the statblock. Sometimes, the offensive actor can apply penalties to the roll.

**Skill checks**, opposed or not, are rolled with the **appropriate attribute** as modifier in **2d6** systems, or **twice the attribute** in **d20** systems. DC target are defined as per the original system.

**Morale** in an unilateral check done when situational like the below arise. It is run with **Will** as modifier on a 2d6 roll.

- After a round during which one or more allied creatures have been reduced to zero HP.
- After a round during which a creature lost half its HP or more. 
- After reinforcements arrive on the enemy side.

| Roll | Result                                                            |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0-3  | Will is broken, they flee immediately                             |
| 4-6  | They retreat strategically                                        |
| 7-9  | They continue to fight, but consider improved strategic positions |
| 10+  | They continue, undeterred                                         |

**Attack** modifiers are defined by **twice the appropriate attribute** executing the attacks, such as **Brawl** for a heavy melee weapon, **Wit** for a ranged weapon or **Will** for a spellcasting attack. **Attack damage** is defined by the weapon used or, in the case of brute force or spellcasting attacks, respectively **Brawl** or **Will** in number of d6s. The **number of attacks** an NPC can execute in one round and their **speed** are defined by **Wit**, as below.

| Wit score         | <-2 |  0  | +2  | +4  | +6  | +8  | >+10 |
| ----------------- |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:----:|
| **# of Attacks**  |  1  |  1  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5   |
| **Speed (in ft)** | 20  | 30  | 40  | 50  | 60  | 70  |  80  |

### Powers & Concepts

In more less gritty games, powers and concepts might be relevant. Other times, technology (such as cybernetics) might be the reason for NPCs to possess powers. During creation, attribute points can be spent to add powers (that can be defined by concepts/words) to a statblock - sometimes a power would cost more than one attribute point. This approach helps maintain internal balance between NPCs of similar HD. Games like Godbound, Best Left Buried, D&D, Nightmares Underneath, etc. have many examples of them. Simple things like improved AC (e.g.: +2 AC per attribute point spent) can also be done with a cost.

### Conversions

From Without Number games
- **Brawl** is `[WN's attack modifier] / 2`, taking into consideration WN's HP and damage
- **Wit** is, reasonably, `[WN'skill]`, taking into consideration WN's Instinct, Speed and number of attacks stat
- **Will** is, reasonably, `[WN's morale] - 7`, taking into consideration effort's requirements
- **Save** is ignored and recalculated based on HD
- **HP** is recalculated based on the hit die defined by **Brawl** (this can be flexible and standardised to d8s)
