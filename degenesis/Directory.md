# System

`terra-v0.0.0`


# Character creation
***Reference: Best Left Buried Zine 1***

PCs have three **Stats**. They are mapped to **KDL**'s ten Attributes.    
- **Brawl**
	- **Fortitude**: physical resistance, pain threshold, ability to exert himself and apply physical force.
	- **Violence**: measures the character’s raw strength, short range fighting expertise, and viciousness.
- **Wit**
	- **Reflexes**: quickness, responsiveness, agility, mobility and marksmanship.
	- **Intuition**: survival, gut feeling, orienteering, empathy, reading intentions and motives.
	- **Perception**: alertness, scanning environments and taking notice of what others overlook.
	- **Coolness**: grace under pressure, stealth, theft, and other situations demanding quick decisions under stress.
	- **Charisma**: charm, leadership, rhetorical talent and manipulation.
- **Will**
	- **Willpower**: mental resilience, composure, faith, and capacity for working through trauma.
	- **Reason**: measures the character’s analytical ability, information gathering and rationalisation.
	- **Soul**: sensitivity to *primal* forces, ability to attune and *focus* on the true reality.




PCs have the original **Attributes** from **DEG**, albeit we will use BLB-friendly values.


three **Stats**: **Brawl**, **Wit** and **Will**. The rules are the same as **BLB**, except the starting values.

**Stats** values can be assigned in any distribution respecting:  
- Sum of all starting **Stats** is `1`
- Each **Stat** is between `-2` and `+2`

PCs also have two resource pools: **Vigour** and **Grip**. For Degenesis, **Grip** will be used a a measure of how far a PC is from becoming infected by Sepsis.

# Character archetypes
***Reference: Degenesis Rebirth Katharsys***

PCs have a Culture (their land), a Cult (their group) and a Concept, instead of **BLB** backgrounds. These are described in **DKS** and should be used narratively to define characters.

The mechanics implementation of character archetypes will follow the Everyman Archetype (**BLB** Zine 2). Choose up to three actions that your character is good at, and the same number for things they are bad at. Use the lists of Skill for Culture, Cult and Concept on **DKS** to get an idea on what characters with those backgrounds are good at, the rest they could be bad at.

Once per scene, for an action the PC is good at, roll the first check with **The Upper Hand**. Conversely, for an action the PC is bad at, roll the first check **Against The Odds**.

# Advancements

Every time PCs accumulate 8 xp, they gain an advancement. Alongside an advancement, a PC also gains +1 **Vigour** and +1 **Grip**.

## General advancements

**Gain +1 in one chosen stat.**  
- Limit is +2 in the first 10 advancements
- Limit is +3 thereafter

**Gain the Upper Hand in one action type**
- Look at DKS skills for options 

**Gain one Rank on your Cult**
## Cult-specific advancements

### Spitalians

**Splaying** (DKS 49)
- Spend 1 Grip to gain +1 armour for one round. This advancement can be used as many times as desired in the same round, granting a higher armour modifier.

**Phalanx** (DKS 49)
- When enemies **Gang Up** on the character, negate the first two instances of the **Upper Hand**.
# Rules
***Reference: Best Left Buried Zine 4***

The resolution mechanics of BLB are used, when not stated differently. For general stat checks, the target number is **reduced from 9+ to 8+**. For combat, basic armour number is **reduced from 8 to 7**.

**Vigour recovery**
- Base rate of one recovered **Vigour** per day.
- It a PC does not have appropriate shelter, food or water, recovery is not possible.
- If someone is treating the PC, one additional Vigour is recovered per day upon a successful **Will** check. The check is **Against The Odds** it there are no appropriate supplies and equipment.

# Consequences
***Reference: Best Left Buried Zine 5 and Metamorphica Revised***

Gaining consequences work the same way the do on **BLB**. Unlike in **BLB**, afflictions will be used to expose Sepsis infestation - as opposed to character flaws and insanity.

To define what is the gained infestation, roll 1d200 and consult **MMR** 146-147. 





From KDL


***Reference: Best Left Buried Zine 1***

PCs have three **Stats**: **Brawl**, **Wit** and **Will**. The rules are the same as **BLB**, except the starting values.

**Stats** values can be assigned in any distribution respecting:  
- Sum of all starting **Stats** is `+2`
- Each **Stat** is between `-2` and `+2`

**Active attributes from KDL (Reason, Intuition, Perception, Coolness, Violence, Charisma, Soul)**
- Choose 2 attributes to be good at - **Stat** checks have **The Upper Hand** (**TUH**)
- Choose 2 attributes to be bad at - **Stat** checks are **Against The Odds** (**ATO**)
- The remaining 3 attributes are neither **TUH** nor **ATO**.

PCs have two resource pools: **Vigour** and **Grip**. These are detailed in **BLB**.
## Advancements

Every time PCs accumulate 8 **Experience**, they add a new **Advancement** and gain +1 **Vigour** and **Grip**.

For each of the first 5 **Advancements**, choose one:  
- Increase one **Stat** in +1 (up to +2)
- Gain +1 **TUH** in an Attribute
- Gain a new Advantage from your Archetype

For each of the **Advancements** between the 6th and the 10th, choose one:  
- Increase one **Stat** in +1 (one stat up to +3, the others up to +2)
- Gain +1 **TUH** in an Attribute
- Gain a new Advantage from any Archetype
- End your PC's story and start a new PC with 2 **Advancements**.

For each of the Advancements after the 10th, choose one:  
- Increase one **Stat** in +1 (one stat up to +4, the others up to +3)
- Gain +1 **TUH** in an Attribute
- Gain a new Advantage from any Archetype
- End your PC's story and start a new PC with 4 **Advancements**.
- Advance your character to an Enlightened Archetype.

## Rules
***Reference: Best Left Buried Zine 4***

The resolution mechanics of BLB are used, when not stated differently. For general **Stat** checks, the target number is **reduced from 9+ to 8+**.

When **KDL** asks for a passive attribute check for Fortitude, Willpower or Reflexes, roll with the **Stats** **Brawl**, **Will** or **Wit** - respectively. When **KDL** asks for an active attribute check, roll a relevant **Stat** and use **the Upper Hand (TUH)** or **Against The Odds (ATO)**, if appropriate.

**Vigour recovery**
- Base rate of one recovered **Vigour** per day.
- It a PC does not have appropriate shelter, food or water, recovery is not possible.
- If someone is treating the PC, one additional Vigour is recovered per day upon a successful **Will** check. The check is **Against The Odds** it there are no appropriate supplies and equipment.

## Consequences
***Reference: Best Left Buried Zine 5 & Kult Divinity Lost***

Gaining consequences work the same way the do on **BLB**. For thematic coherence, afflictions should be chosen from the list of Disadvantages from **KDL** 89.
