***Arrival: A tale of wretched heroes in a broken world***

# Part 1 A kiss from the dark

## Chapter 1 No options outside

A group of strangers, who had all arrived in Watheton for different reasons, found themselves in the local tavern, sharing drinks and stories. There was Guilf, a rugged bard with a quick wit; Miraak, an outcast dragonborn soldier; Kethra a young sorcerer with a mysterious past; Fuko a drow wizard from the Ghost Domain; and Dolman, a brave dwarven scout eager to prove himself. As they chatted, they heard of a large-scale attack of golden dragons in the south, causing widespread panic and chaos. The city of Watheton had no choice but to organise a mass evacuation to the nearby [Tolfoddund mines](realms.md#Tolfonddundhesm).

The group quickly offered to assist the Watheton leaders in ensuring safe passage for the inhabitants of the city. They scouted the road to the mines, fending off attacks from dangers along the way. Upon reaching the mines, the group discovered that their journey was far from over. A former friend of Guilf, Nilperto, had been turned into an undead creature, with a strange tattoo on his neck. The group fought bravely against Nilperto and his minions, eventually defeating them and uncovering a hidden passage that led to the Intermine and further to the Nargun Mines.

## Chapter 2 The Glasrath alliance

As the group emerged from the Intermine, they found themselves on the outskirts of the [Nargun](realms.md#Nargunhesm) stronghold. The dwarves, who had been battling undead attackers for years, welcomed them with open arms. Over the next few weeks, many other people came to the mines seeking protection. Populations and armies from the cities to the south of Watheton, as well as drows from the Ghost Domain, arrived seeking shelter.

Some of the refugees from the cities had actually seen the dragons, offering a varied description of their appearance and abilities. Some said they had never seen anything like them before, while others claimed they had fought dragons in the past, but never ones as these. As tensions rose, the leaders of the various groups appointed the group of five as their representatives. They were tasked with forming an alliance amongst all the armies in order to stand a chance against the approaching horde of undead. 

In the midst of this chaos, the group met Ghuse, a martial cleric from [Algath](religions.md#Algath), the goddess of life and death. As they worked to unite the disparate forces, the group learned more about the strange tattoo on Nilperto's neck. They discovered that it was a mark of the undead army, a sign of their allegiance to a powerful necromancer who was rumoured to be behind the attacks.

With the clock ticking down and the undead army approaching, the group worked tirelessly to coordinate the defences of the mines. They organised the various armies into a cohesive unit, using their unique skills and talents to prepare and equip them for battle. They knew that the battle ahead would be brutal and bloody, but they also knew that they had a chance to turn the tide and protect the innocent people under their care.

## Chapter 3 Battle from Ammuinoth

The Glasrath Alliance now faces a horde of undead marching from the [Ammuinoth](realms.md#Ammuinoth). The battle starts, and three clashes happen in the mines. Miraak is killed, but was lucky enough to be close to Ghuse who starts a long ritual to resurrect him. Fuko also falls in battle, but she is unlucky to sink in the lake, only to be found too late. In the end, the alliance is victorious, but not without many casualties - including the wyrmling gold dragon that was freed by the Glasrath Defenders (the name given to Miraak, Guilf, Kethra, Dolman, and the now deceased Fuko). Access to the city of Khatdzig is established again. The group is celebrated as heroes, and their names are forever etched in the history of these mines. They have faced insurmountable odds and emerged victorious, proving that even in the darkest of times, there is still hope.

# Part 2 Darkness deepens

## Chapter 4 Going to Holzander
***3877.4E, spring***

A new party member joins the Glasrath Defenders - a dust elf cleric of [Mystra](religions.md#Mystra). With the goal of investigating the disappearance of the Gaelire Beikae, the Shield of Beauty, and her Paragon Force - which supposedly came to the Holzander burnt castle 10 years ago - the Glasrath Defenders went into the [Ammuinoth](realms.md#Ammuinoth). In the Castle of Bells they've met Weldon, a very pleasant werebear and then, in the Ardismouth Temple, they fought Tekerluth (who told them she was pregnant from Miraak). Due to combat injuries they decided to look for an exit towards the desert again. The Defenders reached Mystra's temple in the north desert, where they learned of other forces in play. One of them is a strange and powerful power within the Holzander castle. A second one is the religious and military organisation known as the Faithful Faletist Knights of the Arch (FFKA), which burned the Holzander castle 110 years ago, and apparently have some influence on the cities on the surface in the region.

## Chapter 5 A breath from the desert
***3877.5A, summer***

The Glasrath Defenders marched through the desolate landscape of Ammuinoth, their path illuminated only by the dim light of the Ghost Domain. As they approached the Holzander castle, they encountered a Ghost Rider, a cursed creature never before seen in the mortal. The Defenders clashed with the beast, their weapons and spells piercing its ethereal form.

After a brief rest to recover from their wounds, the group pressed on towards the castle. The sight that greeted them was one of destruction and decay. The walls had crumbled and the once-proud turrets were mere ruins. Strange feathery creatures seem to have taken lair in the broken battlements, but none were there while the Defenders entered.

As they searched for a way inside, they discovered a hole in the underkeep that led to the castle's subterranean depths. The group cautiously descended the rickety wooden staircase, the air thick with the stench of bird droppings and decay. At the bottom of the stairs, they stood at the entrance to a dimly-lit chamber. With weapons at the ready, they stepped forward into the unknown, prepared to face whatever terrors awaited them in the depths of the ruined castle.

## Chapter 6 The torturer of Holzander
***3877.5B, summer***

The Glasrath Defenders entered the first level of Holzander's castle, and saw psychotic scenes of torture and death. They met the responsible for them - a torturer known as the Gaoler - who threw in disturbing comments about having tortured Gaelira and killed the Paragon Force. The defenders decided it was too much of it and went on to kill the Gaoler - who had support from animated torture equipment and zombies. The battle that followed was challenging and some of the defenders were significantly hit. Especially Miraak who, during combat, realised he was not really brought back to life by Ghuse, but has been reanimated as an intelligent undead.

After killing the Gaoler, the defenders continued exploring the rooms and found two prisoners and their detainer, an ogre called Scar. The prisoners were Dugan Lovay - a dust elf merchant from the Linhe cities -, her companion, the Red Heart, and a halfling scholar from the capital Throta (in the northwest), who has been researching a disease known as the Lady Scurvy. The disease is some kind of death lycanthropy, but with very different consequences, that started afflicting the region about a year ago.

Scar, the ogre, did not pose a threat to the defenders, and was very relieved that the Gaoler was finally dead. While talking with the prisoners, the group became aware of a magic Mystra's door, through the catacombs, that goes into the surface (probably the lost access to the castle), and that the Gaoler knew the password to open it. Amyria also knows that this password is available in a book in Mystra's temple's library.

In this first level, several monuments existed: a frog statue of a long lost deity, a bowman statue, representing Cauchurn in the death river, and a memorial to the first Holzander, who established the castle, and explored the Brezal Paths that are so rich in the area. The group then decided to venture towards the catacombs, where they met Ushulx, a cultist of Cauchurn. Ushulx partnered with them while they fought shadows coming from the catacombs to the east and south. Everyone was too hurt to continue after, and the party decided to rest in the cells, together with the prisoners and Ushulx, while Scar kept a look for them.

## Chapter 7 The Void claim
***3877.5B, summer***

After a much-needed rest, the defenders huddled together in a dimly lit cell, sharing their knowledge and plans. Amidst the whispers, Ushulx, Durgan, Red Hart, and Ichbon discussed the animosity between Algath and [Curcharn](religions.md#Curcharn), two deities from the Deadecho. They also revealed the presence of other formidable residents in the castle, such as Cagoth-ze, a master of time magic, Danaska, an expert in oozes, and the powerful beings Imortra and Gellert. Ushulx expressed her eagerness to locate Avrindt, the Creep, a red dragon rumoured to have transformed into a death dragon. Meanwhile, Ichbon shared his quest to find a long-lost elven library that may hold knowledge about the Lady Scurvy disease.

The party engaged in a spirited debate about their next move, eventually deciding to venture to the lower level in search of Cagoth-ze. As they explored the second level, they stumbled upon records detailing gruesome ooze experiments and encountered a dangerous trap in the form of a green ink-ooze. Just moments later, Amirya's sharp eyes spotted something extraordinary—a time tributary, a river of time flowing through one of the rooms. In a bold and impulsive act, Guilf stepped forward and crossed the tributary, only to fall unconscious and undergo a magical transformation, becoming significantly younger. It became apparent that Guilf had been claimed by The Void, bound to a contract with this mysterious entity.

As the party deliberated their next steps, they noticed a clockwork servant skulking around the rooms, raising concerns about their safety. Acting swiftly, the group retreated from the second level and sought refuge in the safety of the cells on the first level, strategising their approach and considering the implications of Guilf's newfound contract with [The Void](religions.md#Ethux'zhurh).

## Chapter 8 First sight of Lady Scurvy
***3877.5B3, summer***

With their strength waning and their wounds still fresh, the band of weary heroes embarked on a treacherous journey towards the revered temple of Mystra, their priorities aligned with rejuvenation and restoration. As they traversed the Ammuinoth, their footsteps weighed heavily while caring their wounded. It was during this perilous expedition that their eyes fell upon a grotesque sight—a creature, contorted and abominable, crawling with malevolence along the ceiling. Ichbon recognised the fiendish being as an unfortunate victim infected by the accursed Lady Scurvy disease. Miraak, ever vigilant, discerned disturbing similarities between the creature's combat tactics and the vile vampire spawns employed by the armies of D'Elsin during the savage southern war. A battle ensued, arduous and fraught with peril, but it culminated in a final, decisive blow dealt by Kethra.

Days later, they reached the temple and met an old acquaintance of Amyria's, Jandar from the Desolate Flats, who informed them of undead ravaging Linhe. The FFKA, stalwart guardians of this strategic territory, had valiantly stood against the encroaching darkness. He was astonished as he discovered that the presumed fallen Glasrath Defenders still clung to life, offering their aid to the beleaguered region.

Rested, they headed to Gimorkoc, facing a rare thunderstorm. The storm, as abruptly as it had materialised, eventually receded. A Rurkinar ritual, an esoteric ceremony seldom witnessed, was poised to commence, orchestrated by the cultists' enigmatic high shaman. Their aim? To establish communion with the Angel Hound, a being of enigmatic power and purpose. Yet, amidst the gathering darkness and whispered incantations, Guilf, beset by a profound sense of disquiet, caught sight of a face within the throng—a visage hauntingly familiar, the countenance of his long-lost mother. Driven by an irresistible force, he chased after her, his companions hot on his heels.

![](https://i.imgur.com/XQExAKj.png)

## Chapter 9 The Rurkinar ritual
**3877.5F6, summer**

The valiant champions pursued Guilf's enigmatic mother. Yet, as they delved deeper into the unfathomable abyss of her powers, their fortitude waned, and their resolute spirits trembled. Guilf's mother possessed an indomitable mastery of Theurgy, a formidable force that unleashed abominations that sent shivers crawling along their spines, freezing their very souls.

Reluctantly, the group retraced their steps to the central square, drenched in a torrential downpour and an ethereal glow emanating from the ancient temple stones. The ritual to commune with the dreaded Angel Hound was underway. The air grew thick with anticipation as the incantations surged and chaos erupted, a violent upheaval that seized the cultists with ferocious might, wrenching them away to the somber castle ward under the merciless grip of the FFKA.

Undeterred by the dark turn of events, the heroes, cloaked in the veils of night, ventured into the shadowed heart of the castle ward. It was Guilf, his heart filled with courage and empathy, who dared to breach the psychic barriers of the Rurkinar Shaman. The long-awaited culmination of the ritual revealed the prison that ensnared the Angel Hound - the enigmatic Holzander Castle. The Shaman's arduous work had reached its fateful conclusion.

With the dawning of the morrow came the arrival of General Sergarus—a figurehead both dreaded and revered in Linhe. It was Sergarus who extended his impenetrable hand, granting clemency to the cultists detained in the night's embrace, save for the Shaman. In a damning judgment of treason, the Shaman was sentenced to the ghastly fate of impalement. Two hours later, under the watchful gaze of the village, the order was carried out by an FFKA knight with merciless precision.

## Chapter 10 Desert road
***3877.6A6, autumn***

The party became aware that the Faithful Faletist Knights of the Arch (FFKA) marked them as a group consisting of two adults, two children, and one old brute - an unconventional combination that added an air of mystery to their reputation.  As the heroes delved deeper into the mysteries of the land, they discovered that the thunderstorms in the region of Linhe had grown increasingly frequent and perilous. Prayers to Rurkinar, the Brown Eagle god, had fallen upon deaf ears, leaving the land vulnerable to the raging storms that now wreaked havoc upon the countryside. This disquieting revelation hinted at a growing imbalance in the forces that governed the realm.

Undeterred by these challenges, the group forged ahead, deciding to make their way towards Eyaram, where they would assess their options for reaching the Holzander castle from the desert. However, their plans took an unexpected turn when a scout arrived from the east, bearing troubling news. Another horde of undead had launched an attack on the countryside, specifically targeting the lands east of Eyaram. A detachment of the FFKA was dispatched to gather more information, while their commander, Sergarus, remained stationed in Gimorkoc.

The journey towards Eyaram commenced, and for the first two days, the group's path remained uneventful, save for the peculiar sight of ancient organic structures that hinted at a forgotten past predating recorded history. On the third day, they found themselves navigating a treacherous gorge, realising that descending into its depths would render them vulnerable to unseen dangers. Opting for a safer route around the cliff, fate interceded in the form of a solitary figure - a protector of the road and an outcast of the Nurderad dragonborn known as Gulthas Morseth.

Gulthas bore a burdened past, having been a participant in the raid of the mines under the influence of the battlemage Grezar. Near death's door, Gulthas uncovered the true nature of his tormentor - a shadow dragon in disguise. The revelation struck a chord with Amyria, who recognised the description of the shadow dragon from ancient lore. These creatures had long dwelled deep within the Earth, slumbering for ages. They had departed from the material world, received by Algath's blessings, only to return with nefarious intentions.

Parting ways with Gulthas, the group continued their journey towards the ruined Temple of Remains. There, they engaged in skirmishes with weakened undead adversaries, their collective strength proving superior in combat. Kethra's devastating power nearly laid waste to the entire ruin, but amid the chaos, a discovery awaited them—a tight, cold, and ominously glowing dark red tunnel that seemed to descend into the depths, perhaps leading to the enigmatic Ophaire. Amyria, channeling the divine might of her goddess Mystra, unleashed a wave of holy energy that obliterated seven undead creatures with a mere sight. The potency of her connection to Mystra became evident, further solidifying her status as a beacon of divine power within the group.

As they navigated the Temple of Remains, they unraveled its past purpose - a prison once held captive Algath, the goddess of death herself. The remnants of the ancient power that had resided within its walls left a haunting imprint, a reminder of the forces that once shaped the land. With caution and wisdom, the party decided to explore other areas of the ruined temple, aware that each step took them deeper into the heart of darkness that permeated the land. Uncertainty loomed over them, but their resilience and determination remained unwavering as they braced themselves for the secrets yet to be unveiled within the Temple of Remains.

## Chapter 11 Aivridyt's past
***3877.6B4, autumn***

In the grim depths of the Temple of Remains, the group of broken heroes came to a startling realisation - the tumultuous skirmish they had ignited upon their arrival had awoken other malevolent entities that lurked within the ancient halls dedicated to the death goddess.  No sooner had the group taken a defensive stance than they found themselves cornered by two Blessed Dead Adepts, abominations that wielded an unholy mastery over the forces of death. These dark necromancers were accompanied by their grotesque minions, the slave husks—twisted, pitiful figures bound to their malevolent will. The direst of all was the zombie clot, a monstrous amalgamation of hundreds of decaying bodies, writhing and pulsating with an insatiable hunger for flesh. Desperation filled the air as the group fought fiercely against their relentless adversaries. In the midst of the chaotic battle, Kethra, once again facing the clutches of death, found herself almost consumed by the ravenous corpses. Salvation came in the form of Guilf, whose quick thinking conjured a shroud of magical darkness, enveloping the battlefield and granting Kethra a slim chance of escape.

The following day, they took a moment to gather themselves and explored the remaining recesses of the ruined temple. Amidst the hundreds of tombs that lined the halls, their eyes fell upon four imposing statues and a tome written in the ancient draconic script. Two of the statues bore a chilling familiarity - Ghuse and Grezar, names that resonated with historical significance. However, the inscriptions on the statues hinted at a disquieting revelation - the beings masquerading as Ghuse and Grezar were mere facades, vessels assumed by none other than Aivridyt herself, carrying out her sinister machinations. The depths of her treachery were only beginning to reveal themselves.

Leaving the temple behind, the group continued their arduous journey along the desert road. Soon, they encountered a sight both awe-inspiring and foreboding: a towering, ancient metal statue. Filled with a childlike curiosity, Guilf, unable to resist its allure, decided to perch within the statue's mouth, immediately succumbing to a reverie that transcended mortal understanding. He found himself in communion with Mondendovil, the Ngar'tho Void - an ancient deity of the depths.

Mondendovil spoke of the colossal statue as his long-lost physical form, and conveyed a chilling prophecy - the time for his return drew near. His devoted servants would soon arrive to reconnect his powerful mind with his formidable body, a union that would reshape the very fabric of existence. The implications of this encounter sent shivers coursing through the group's spines, stirring a profound urgency within their hearts.

Reluctantly leaving the enigmatic statue behind, the group pressed on, their sense of purpose heightened. The road led them to the Dwarf enclave of Durnum, where they sought respite and replenishment, even as the weight of their impending destiny hung heavily upon their shoulders.

## *Dramatis Personae*: Aivridyt, the Creep
***Also known as: The Purple Evil, Ghuse, Grezar and other names***

In the shadowed annals of time, Aivridyt, once a small and ferocious female red dragon known as the Creep, ruled with a malevolence that sent shivers coursing through the Naragzah mountains. This fearsome creature, driven by a sinister curiosity, delved ever deeper into the labyrinthine caverns that lay beneath, venturing into the sacred mines of the two dwarven clans that called those depths their domain. The encounters with the Creep became a recurring nightmare for the Tolfoddund and Nargun warriors, who suffered greatly at her wrathful claws. It was in the year 3856 NC, amidst the blood-soaked peaks of the mountains, that an alliance was forged between the battered clans. United, they struck a grievous blow, leaving Aivridyt wounded and retreating into the dark recesses below.

Humbled and wounded, the Creep sought solace in the unfathomable depths of the Ghost Domain. For six long years, she slumbered, her formidable essence cocooned in the embrace of darkness. Unbeknownst to her, during her deep slumber, a passage opened, beckoning her to the eerie realm known as the Dead Echo. Aivridyt was ensnared by its tendrils, and when she awoke, her once-vibrant scales had transmuted into a twisted shadow red, its hues akin to that of viscous petroleum, intertwined with accents of haunting purple. The Creep had become the Purple Evil—a creature steeped in darkness and corruption.

To her dismay, the Purple Evil discovered that she had come to bear eggs, a phenomenon unheard of in the annals of draconic lore for millennia. Her progeny's arrival was an unexpected twist of fate, and she laid the eggs in a cavernous lair, inadvertently attracting the attention of a destitute family dwelling perilously close to the mountains. Swift and merciless, the Purple Evil dispatched the parents, but she saw potential in the seven-year-old child, Kethra Stormwind. Cunningly, she donned the guise of a gentle sage, veiling her true nature beneath a veneer of wisdom and compassion. Kethra was ensnared in a perpetual state of drowsiness, ensorcelled by the Purple Evil's potent magic and elixirs, deceived into believing she was raised by the sage in her humble abode. The Purple Evil harboured no clear plans for the child, and her careless machinations led to an unforeseen turn of events. Kethra, awakening from her prolonged stupor, escaped the clutches of the lair, leaving behind the twisted enchantments that had held her captive.

In her insatiable hunger for power, Aivridyt, assuming the guise of Ghuse, a human guard captain and cleric devoted to Algath, the goddess of life and death, plotted her ascent in the city of Gorthugke. From the shadows, she manipulated her way to the pinnacle of military command, her influence spreading like a dark stain across the region. In tandem, she concocted a macabre alliance with Grezar, a necromancer dwelling among the dragonborn of Nurderad. The nefarious Grezar orchestrated a vengeful assault upon the Tolfoddund dwarves, reaping havoc upon their land—a cruel act of retribution for the Creep's past transgressions. It was also Grezar that, years before, sent Miraak much too young to battle, where his body and soul burned, becoming a faint memory of a once fearless dragonborn warrior.

## *Interlude*: A dream of Makab

In the depths of their wearied minds, some of the Glasrath defenders share a nightmare, one that plagued their restless slumber. This nightmarish vision transported them to an ancient temple shrouded in the mists of the sea - a place of forgotten rituals and unspeakable horrors.

Within the dream, they found themselves thrust into the midst of a sinister ceremony, their presence intended to thwart the unfolding ritual. Yet, as the dream progressed, a chilling realisation dawned upon them - the Glasrath defenders themselves were integral to the very ritual they sought to disrupt. Their every action, their every step, was predetermined, inexorably woven into this malevolent enchantment.

Enigmatic beings, known as Ngar'thos, stood as mere witnesses, their forms twisted and alien, indifferent to the mortals' plight. And at the centre of it all stood the Eldritch Furnace, a conduit to realms unimaginable, where Ethux'zhurh, an embodiment of The Void, awaited its unwitting prey.

As the dream neared its crescendo, Kimbarak, driven by desperation and armed with a golden dagger, believed it to be his salvation - a weapon that could sever the grasp of The Void and restore balance. But the cruel irony of the nightmare unfolded before their eyes. As Kimbarak raised the dagger, it was not The Void that was halted, but Kimbarak himself who became ensnared within the swirling tapestry of reality, forever condemned to serve as a slave spirit to the ancient horrors that lurked beyond.

With despair gnawing at their hearts, the remaining defenders made a fateful decision - to flee the accursed temple and escape the clutches of Ethux'zhurh. Their footsteps echoed through the corridors and inhumane rooms, a desperate bid for survival. Yet, Guilf's dream diverged from the others, his nightmare ending with a chilling embrace by The Void itself, an all-encompassing darkness that dragged him relentlessly into the unfathomable depths of the sea. Miraculously, the surviving defenders, in a stroke of sheer luck, managed to sail away from the awakening Ethux'zhurh, evading its wrath and preserving their tenuous hold on existence.

## Chapter 12 Finding Holzander once more

- The broken Glasrath defenders spent a week amongst the dwarves in the mining enclave of Durnum. 
- In an action of kindness, Amyria offered food to the famine dwarves, and promised help dealing with the Dust Elves traders under Neeleu, so that they are less aggressive with their quotas.
- They learned that the enclave of Durnum was built in an ancient construction shaft that connects to another Ammuinoth tunnel.
- While talking with Glorizerlug Chaosfoot, they learned that the war in the south is being lost, which forced the Kiranu dwarves to abandon their houses in the mountains and migrate north protected by the Nurderad Dragonborn.
- The heroes warned of the possible dangers lingering in the Glasrath mountains, if the Kiranu were to take shelter there. Dolman was divided if he wanted to go back to Glasrath and possibly protect his Kirano kin, or march forth towards the castle and all the answers that he was looking for. The party decided on continue to the castle.
- In a wise move, Guilf looked into the dwarves mind to see the how to get to the Holzander Castle, which saved them hours of search in the desert.
- From the enclave, the party decided to continue their journey to Holzander through the desert, which was safe until the old ruins of Dannamore, where an entrance to the castle was to be found.
- While reaching the ruins of Dannamore, under a heavy thunderstorm, the party was chased into the ruins by a storm spirit.
- Inside the ruins the Glasrath defenders run into a detached band of Anak Warriors who were also fleeing the war in the south, and in an instinctive act of violence Kethra attacked them.
- The fight that ensued was not easy, and Miraak found himself stabbed to almost death by a nimble Anak that was hiding in one of the ruined walls. In the end, the broken heroes won this sad encounter, feeling cursed by their choice of killing innocent creatures.
- What followed was: finally finding the magic Mystra's door that accessed the castle of Holzander, getting in and, after a quick skirmish with undead tomb guardians known as Revenants, finding Ushlux again.
- While all that happened, Guilf had another opportunity to speak with The Void through the toad statue, and learned the terrible truth that his soul has been promised to that entity many years ago, by Guilf's own mother.

## Chapter 13 The Ancient Elven Library

- The Glasrath defenders found themselves in a network of intrigue at the second level of the Holzander Castle. Danaska, an arcane scholar, wanted Cagoth-Ze, dealt with and proposed the group of heroes to take the task. The group did not agree to do the work, and went and met Cagoth-Ze, which had similar plans for Danaska - which the group again declined. Cagoth-Ze then made an alternative proposal, where the group would kill the Ngar'tho that was imprisoned in the summoning circle. The group again declined, and went parley with the creature, who only wanted to be made free.
- In the end, the deal the broken heroes took was with the Ngar'tho, in exchange of valuable information. They learnt that Galiera is being hold on the third level by the Blighted - a slave race of Gellert. The group also learnt how to reach the library, which is hidden 100 thousand years in the future, among other valuable information. After the deal was completed the Ngar'tho vanished in thin air.
- With the Ngar'tho free, and Cagoth-Ze believing the party had destroyed it, the group was now welcome into Cagoth's area in the level, and travelled with the time construct towards the library.
- The time travel showed the group a series of imprints of the world, in the past and in the future, that each could only observe for a fraction of second. Some images were disturbing.
- After spending a few hours on the library conducting their research, the group came back to the present time with the time construct, and at that moment the group saw itself divided: Dolman, Guilf and Amyria were decided to continue on the castle, until they find Galiera, while Miraak and Kethra decided to pursue their destiny and face Ghuse. The group said their farewells, hoping they would find each other in the future.
