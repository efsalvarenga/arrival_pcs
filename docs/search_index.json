This document is not intended to be self-contained, and requires other books. HTL: Hostile Setting (link to view-only pdf and publisher) SWN: Stars Without Number (link to view-only pdf or get for free) MMR Metamorphica Revised (link to view-only pdf and purchase) - used only for mental decay. Directory Context Hostile is a tabletop RPG set in a universe that combines elements of gritty science fiction, horror, and political intrigue. It is heavily inspired by the aesthetics and themes of classic 1970s and 1980s sci-fi movies such as “Alien,” “Blade Runner,” and “Outland.” The game is designed to evoke a sense of being on the edge of known space, where human life is cheap, corporate interests dominate, and the unknown looms at every corner. Space is a hostile environment, not just because of its physical dangers but also due to the socio-political landscape. The game emphasises themes of corporate greed, the expendability of human life in the pursuit of profit, and the struggle of the working class against oppressive systems. Political intrigue plays a significant role, with factions within and between corporations, as well as other groups with their agendas, vying for power and influence. Themes Gritty sci-fi: Characters are blue collar spacers, working dangerous jobs in the hostility of space. Every hazard is trying to kill characters all the time. Everything in the world that isn’t an active corporate interest is run down, decaying, and stained. Earth is a traditional cyberpunk setting, but in space there is much less “street violence”, and cybernetics are generally not reliable. List of hazards: lack of oxygen, vacuum, radiation, excessive cold, excessive heat, aliens, alien infections, poisonous atmosphere, high pressure atmosphere, high decompression rate and high gravity acceleration in large bodies. Horror &amp; fear: A cynical world, filled with everyday people going about their jobs is a common starting point for good horror stories. Humans are not alone in the universe. Alien predators have been found in multiple worlds, and sometimes even in asteroids. Advanced alien societies had their remnants found by earth explorers, but intelligent life is still to be observed. Some theorists say they have been found, and are among us. And none knows when and where aliens will be found. Political intrigue &amp; treachery: Several factions with their own motives and goals. Everyone is out for their own interests, and they’re trustworthy only so long as their interests align with yours. Everyone assumes that deals will be kept only so long as they’re mutually profitable and relationships will only continue as long as they offer benefits to all parties. Factions are classified in 3 groups: Technology &amp; resourceful factions: the strongest group, mostly formed by Mega Corporations and their subsidiaries. Belief factions: their Influence is subtle and ideological, mostly formed by religions and conspiracy theorists Rising authoritative supra-government: early years of an attempt of Earth governments to regain control from the Mega Corporations hands - the Terran Mandate. More detail on the Hostile book, pages 9-10. Aesthetic The aesthetic of Hostile is defined by its gritty, realistic approach to science fiction. Technology is not clean and advanced but rather functional, often run-down, and always with a practical purpose. Cybernetics are unreliable, and life in space is hazardous, with threats such as lack of oxygen, radiation, and alien infections being commonplace. The setting is designed to feel lived-in, with every location showing signs of wear and decay, reflecting the hard life of those who dwell in space. Relevant history Based on our current history until present time. From now, until 2225: SWN book, pages 121-122 HTL setting book, pages 12-22 Relevant locations HTL setting book contains details on most of the systems and worlds, corporations, factions, etc. System Stars Without Number is a sandbox-style science fiction tabletop RPG that embraces an “old-school renaissance” gaming philosophy, drawing mechanical inspiration from classic RPGs of the 1970s. It’s designed to support a wide range of sci-fi adventures, from gritty mercenary actions to space opera, allowing players and game masters significant freedom to shape the game to their interests. Different than old school D&amp;D, SWN has a much simpler class system, with most of the customisation done through background, foci (i.e. feats) and a robust skill system (based on classic Traveler - which is the skill system of the Hostile game too). Additional flavour from other games are always welcomed (OSR compatible preferred, but anything can be discussed): Any rule, class, foci, etc from any OSR game can be considered. Sine Nomine books are very easy to integrate with each other. I have a few of them if someone is interested. Character creation Stars Without Number 3-25 Classes available: warrior, expert or mix/adventurer (i.e. no magic or psionic powers) Everyone starts at level 1 with max HP (reduces hp jump at first level). Character sheet: fillable pdf, Google sheets or freebooter app Replacements: Upon character death: start at level 1. Upon character retirement: start at half the level of the retired character. Character development Advancements Stars Without Number 56 We will use the slower progression rules from WWN/CWN, instead of SWN’s normal progression. Each session grants 1 to 3 XP. |400 Mental decay Short term (stress) PC’s individual (short term) stress is abstracted to a game pace mechanics: Tension Pool. The Tension Pool is managed by the GM. Long term (affliction) Long term mental decay (i.e. Afflictions) happens when it is narratively coherent. Long term mental decay is not a major theme of Hostile, so it will be used sparingly. The GM will ask for a Mental Save when there is a chance to develop an Affliction and they will be randomly rolled on the following MMR table. Physical decay Short term (criticals) Upon rolling a natural 20 on an Attack roll, deal damage with 2x the normal damage dice. Long term (injuries) When PCs are Mortally Wounded, they gain an injury. When their Frailty is over, they can make a Physical Save. If successful their injury is also recovered, otherwise their injury becomes a permanent one. The following table is derived from Cities Without Number, for thematic coherence with Hostile. d12 Injury 1 Gut wound: -1 penalty to a random physical attribute modifier. 2 Brain damage: -1 penalty to a random mental attribute modifier. 3 Trauma: Gain an affliction. 4 One eye is ruined. 5-6 Left (5) or right (6) leg is ruined. 7-8 Left (7) or right (8) arm is ruined. 9-10 System damage: Gain +1 permanent System Strain. 11-12 Just a flesh wound: It’s not that bad of a hit after all. Equipment lists Equipment from the SWN book is considered the standard most common equipment available. We are in year 2225, which means the maximum available technology is TL4 (SWN 63) More specific items, such as those from Hostile books, will cost their $ value in credits, sometimes being significantly more expensive than common equipment.

An ice sample was bought by Tharsis’ Parkfield Biolabs, which contained RNA that can be used to cure early dementia caused by frequent faster than light travel. The RNA named Neuroplasticity Augmentor Sequence (NAS-RNA), however, the RNA cannot be easily replicated in laboratory. For this reason, the discovery was not made public yet, and Tharsis has been moving fast to evaluate the feasibility to establish an ice mine in the system. If proven feasible, the existence of the Brightside Mining Station in the system is an advantage. The station is a poorly managed facility that would be easy to purchase if the exploration proves commerciality of the play (see Hostile-Setting 82, for detail on the licensing process). Perdurabo is a system blazing with the murderous light of a red giant star. The hard-bitten miners of the Brightside Mining Station maintain the only outpost of civilisation in a system filled with lethal light and stellar outlaws. Ancient asteroid sky tombs lie in the vicinity while a seething rebellion boils beneath Brightside Station’s steel skin. Contract Contract signed with Tharsis Mining General Manager for Ice Exploration John McLeod. You are the crew going to Perdurabo. You main goal is to execute the Exploration Framework that enables the commercial evaluation of the Ice Mine play. Non-disclosed milestones, that will be paid off books, is infiltrating and deteriorating the leadership of Brightside station, so its later acquisition is even cheaper. Contracted roles and milestones are detailed below. Monthly salary is Salary + Multiplier x Profession Rank. Each milestone pays a bonus of a number of times the crew monthly salary. The crew will have a LTDA company where they are the shareholders. Basic ship maintenance &amp; fuel is paid by shipowner, additional repairs &amp; fuels are paid by the LTDA (discounted for contract payment). Ship must dock for life support supplies every 6 weeks (max life support is 2 months). Work shifts are 12x12, 7 days a week. You will carry a holographic AI suitcase to speak with the GM weekly on Saturdays. Replacements (in case of sickness or indisposition) will be sent from the fastest system where they can be available.

Perdurian Frostbreaker Certificate of Flight This is to certify that the mission &quot;Perdurian Frostbreaker 2&quot; Registration Number: SGX-4721-IPB is authorized and cleared for operations on the Perdurabo system for the purpose of ice mine exploration. This certification is valid for a duration of one standard Earth year, beginning on the date of issuance. It can be renewed every year for 2 additional years. Captain: Olaf Gustafson Ship ID: ECS Starbounder Frostbreaker GSV-112578 Crew ID: Pentagon Date of Issuance: September 20, 2225 By the authority of the Mining Regulatory Agency, this restricted license certificate grants the holder the right to navigate the asteroids of Perdurabo with the aforementioned starship. It is understood that the crew of the starship shall adhere to all safety protocols, follow mining regulations, and report any unusual discoveries or incidents to the Consortium immediately. This certificate is subject to revocation in the event of safety violations or any activities deemed harmful to the Consortium&#39;s interests. Safe travels and may your ice mining endeavors yield bountiful resources. Authorized by: Director Seraphina Thornblade Director of the Mining Regulatory Agency Date: September 20, 2225 Perdurabo The Doomborgs On the evening before the mission kick-off meeting with Tharsis Mining Manager for Ice Exploration John McLeod, the crew find a scientist from Haruna tied to a bomb in the toilets of a bar in French Guiana. They learn of the animosity of the Lebkuchen activists against Haruna’s cloning endeavours. After all that is sorted, they decide to bet on Olaf in a boxing ring, which proves to be successful. On the next day they finally meet with John McLeod, and preparations for the travel to Perdurabo start. 1.1 The Frostbreaker The Doomborgs crew arrives in Brightside. Brightside is a space mining station owned by Haruna, part of the Matsuyama group. The crew meets a few of the faces on the station and take a space raft to their own ship, which is stationary close by Brightside. After a quick inspection, the Frostbreaker seems in order, and the crew get back to Brightside to sign paperwork. While mingling a bit more with the inhabitants of the station, they end up befriending Marius, a scientific representative from Makita (part of the Wu-Ketai group). He is invited for a mission launch party onboard the Frostbreaker and, on the way there, the crew also invites Roland. Everyone gets drunk and drugged and some information is learned: Marius thinks his job is demeaning while Roland has data that incriminates Yash (Brightside Director) of embezzlement. In the following morning the crew have a virtual meeting with John McLeod, who is unhappy that some information might have leaked about the intention to drill ice in the asteroid. Olaf takes a decision to visit one of the sky tombs in the region, to pretend the crew is one of adventurers and dismiss questions. The crew goes back and negotiate with Marius and Ranse, and they purchase the coordinates of one of the sky tombs that could possess some riches. MadSpark’s version of the story &gt; MadSpark doesn’t remember much of this, his version of events goes as follows &gt; - arrived at a space station after a boring travel but made a neat little BB Gun from my seatbelt &gt; - got told to put my shotgun in a locker (but luckily kept my hunting knife) &gt; - found some great spare parts for the little drone I’ve been planning to make &gt; - the ship has a basic but adequately equipped workshop, so started work on the drone &gt; - everyone wanted to explore the space station &amp; I needed a drink anyway so off we went &gt; - then there were some of these guys who had a bug in their asses about something to do with stealing (apparently it’s not allowed here… 🤷🏼‍♂️) but the skipper sorted it out &amp; then we headed to the bar (it’s interesting that the cameras here are ATX18956 model - I haven’t seen those of years, I’ll have to take one apart at some point for nostalgic reasons) &gt; - I bought drinks all night &amp; did that trick with the exploding gunpowder shots - I don’t remember much after that &gt; - Oh yeah, we’re going to see if we can find some valuable alien artefacts to make some extra moolah 💰(sounds more interesting than the mission anyway!) 1.2 The Cold Tomb The Doomborgs crew arrive in the Cold Tomb. The structure was built in an ice chunk in one of the asteroids in the Perdurabo system. The ship is docked in the entrance of the tomb, and Olaf and Oliver suit up and are ready in the air lock. Through a scan they know that beyond the tomb entrance door the environment is filled with icy water. The two crewmen venture inside, with a system of communication and power umbilicals and a 50 meter harness cable. Sabaka stays behind in the airlock ready to rewind the cable if necessary. In the entrance room, shaped like a sphere, they record on their cameras alien language carved in the icy wall, and an image depicting a blurred humanoid alien in what seems like a position of power. While this was happening, MadSpark feels the need of action, and leaves the ship in a second airlock. While investigating the surroundings of the construction, he detects faint biological matter readings on his suit. He communicates that to Olaf and Oliver, who now turn on their precise detectors too, receiving the same readings. The crew hypothesise that the readings are coming from the water (melted from the asteroid ice), and take a sample from inside the tomb. MadSpark gets back on the ship and take the sample to the lab. He starts to feel dizzy. In the tomb, Oliver and Olaf reach another room where they find dozens of alien bodies floating in the water. They quickly grab one and, in a haste movement, decide to retreat to the spaceship. On their way back, a drone swims in their direction and shoots a shard of metal in their direction, but the crewmen were faster and lock themselves in the airlock before the drone can enter. Oni skillfully undock the Frostbreaker from the tomb and pilot the ship back to Brightside. After decontaminating the air, Olaf and Oliver join the crew in the ship again, but now everyone is feeling slightly sick, unfocused and dizzy. On the way back, some movement readings withing the starship structure alert Oni. The crew quickly retreat to the citadel and command the ship from there. They soon see in the cameras a dozens crab-like alien creatures exploring she starship. MadSpark flushes the starship atmosphere. At the same time Olaf starts to feel very sick and anxious. He thinks for a brief moment that MadSpark is flushing the citadel and panics. The other crew members calm him down, and they all see the crab creatures passing out. Upon arrival in Brightside, Yash Dutta does not allow the immediate off boarding of the crew due to contamination risk, and Olaf decides to speak with John McLeod. John quickly decides that the finding is too high profile, and the Doomborgs are ordered to immediatelly travel back to Earth. After a failed attempt to threat Yash, the Frostbreaker departs from Brightside. The destination is the Teegarden’s Star system, where in the main world (Defiance) a remote office of Tharsis and the ICO (Interstellar Commerce Organisation) are available. 1.3 Defiance and Back The Doomborgs crew travel to the neighbour system: the Teegarden’s Star. During the spike drill, Bennet used the time to execute a biopsy on one of the crab creatures that infested the starship previously. The doctor was very unlucky when a splash of acid hits his eyes, blinding him. Upon arriving on Teegarden’s Star, the captain makes contact with the system control and gets redirected to the Tharsis Mining office on the Defiance. A shuttle picks the crew from orbit and a truck and a car takes them and the corpse to the corporation estate. The Doomborgs meet Lucas, a rough operations coordinator in the system, who explains next steps: they are to complete the mining contract as fast as possible, avoiding any further information leak. The Boxer crew, a group of mercenaries, will be responsible for collecting the remaining corpses and taking them to Earth. While the meeting goes on, Bennet is in the hospital, and learns his eyes are doomed. He will need a cybernetic implant, and that can be arranged within a week. The crew meets again, and decide that waiting a week would be too long. Sabaka connects on the dark web and finds a fixer that can help them get a second hand cybereyes set within a day. The Doomborgs agree with the fixer and go to the appointed location, a district nightclub. In the nightclub they meet an energetic girl, who are to guide them getting the second hand cybereyes - from someone wearing it! They get into a VIP booth, where the target is having fun with what looks like a prostitute. The crew is swift and put the target on the floor, while the girl they just met “pops off” his eyes. The group successfully drive to a shady cybernetic clinic where Bennet has his new eyes implanted. They are ready to continue their mining contract now, and travel back to Perdurabo. In the Cold Tomb, they find the Leadbelly docked to the tomb, while The Boxer’s ship - the Brutomaker - is docked to the second airlock of the Leadbelly. Oni docks the Frostbreaker to the Brutomaker. MadSpark starts the first drone, but an issue with setting the explosives on the ice chunk means that drone is lost in space. Olaf speaks with The Boxer over comms, and they agree to meet and trade a drone from the Brutomaker. The Doomborg meets The Boxer and his crew, while they loot the Cold Tomb and move the valuables to the Brutomaker. The crew of the Leadbelly is tied up and gagged, and left in the Leadbelly for the Doomborgs to figure out. Then, suddenly, while being playful with the new drone, MadSpark cause an accident and an oxygen leak in the Brutomaker. The two crews start running, but most of The Boxer’s crew was further in the aft of the starship, and are lost to space with everything in that part of the ship when it explodes. Bennet and MadSpark are safe in the Frostbreaker, while Oni, Olaf and Sabaka - together with TheBoxer and his engineer and the hostages - are safe in the Leadbelly. 1.4 MadSpark perishes TheBoxer is pissed off but also afraid: Were them send by the ico? Are they here to kill us?! Who sent you? Who fucking sent you??!! TheBoxer mentions he will kill MadSpark, but Olaf asks him not to take any actions The Doomborgs count their numbers, after the explosion of the Brutomaker. It seems Sabaka is missing in action. Most of TheBoxer ’s crew has also perished. There is a high stakes discussion between TheBoxer and Olaf, where the boxer agrees to stay in the Leadbelly while the Doomborgs discuss. Oni communicates with Oliver Bennet and MadSpark who are on the Frostbreaker, and agree on a debris-free area to dock both ships. MadSpark does a fearsome flyby with the Frostbreaker, scaring Oliver Bennet. Olaf and Oni try to convince MadSpark to retire from the crew, after the unfortunate actions of MadSpark. They propose tying up the engineer to guarantee everyone’s safety. Madspark does not agree, and runs and locks himself in the workshop. Olaf, afraid of what could happen in the workshop makes a tough decision and commands all crew to go to the bridge, while he flushes the air from the ship. MadSpark perishes trying to escape though a ventilation shaft. Oliver questions the leadership of Olaf: “Sir, I don’t think you are leading us for the successful completion of our contract. Now we don’t have all required skills in the crew. We need those skills - I could’t care less for the human lives lost.” |400 Considering his remaining options, TheBoxer sees an opportunity to forge his own death and finally retire in a small farm in Defiance. This setup is agreed with everyone, but it requires erasing the proofs of Boxer being alive - which includes killing the hostages from the Leadbelly. The Boxer and Oliver coldly push RanseHardlee, RandallBellows, JaffaOkoye from the airlock. The Boxer parks the Leadbelly in a hidden coordinate in the asteroid field. The crew takes the Frostbreaker to BrightsideStation. An afraid YashDutta greets them, and allow them to refuel, but not to enter the station. Oni skilfully uninstall the lead panels from theFrostbreaker, so they can land the ship in Defiance to drop the Boxer. 1.5 The Boxer’s box The Doomborgs took their time and evaluated all the options to unload TheBoxer into Defiance. They decide that putting The Boxer in a large box is the best alternative. They called flight control from Defiance and requested to speak with tharsisMining. Lucas called back and agreed to find a maintenance bay for the Frostbreaker in two days. Oni skilfully (again) landed the Frostbreaker through a light storm for Defiance’s standards. |400 Lucas spoke again with the crew, and was astonished to know that JohnMcLeod speaks with the crew through an AI version of himself - this is not allowed on Earth. Lucas also updates the crew that information leaked about the alien bodies, and the possible extraction of the mRNA - which is expensive in the market. Olaf becomes anxious, and postpone the next chat with JohnMcLeod Danny and Oliver go to a local lowlife bar and meet the owner of a small and shady logistics company, Harry. Harry agrees to take the box and ask no questions. |400 The crew meet again at the bay, prepare everything and load the box with The Boxer into Harry’s company truckers’ truck. The crew speaks with JohnMcLeod who confirms what Lucas has shared. John mentions that there is an inevitable gold rush about to start for Perdurabo. The crew is to be back there ASAP, and start mining as much as possible. A new contract will be sent to them. After the long day, Oliver goes take a nap, while the others decide to continue drinking into the small hours. In the same low life bar the crew meet a (very drunk) CassianVireo Cassian mentions she is an investigator, and she wants to get information on what is happening in BrightsideStation and the Perdurabo system. Cassian offers her skills in computing and communications in return to be brought to Brightside. The crew is undecided and were to speak with her again next day, before departing Defiance. |400 1.6 Start of Dutta’s fall The Doomborgs receive a new contract that voids the exploration framework of the previous contract, but maintain taking down the directorship of BrightsideStation The crew will be paid C5k for each Hull cargo space full of unrefined mRNA-rich ice. This value is doubled if the ice is refined. The Doomborgs try to find a mobile extractor micro refinery to install on their ship, but that was too difficult in a planet like Defiance. Oni sends a message to her friend in TheSolomons and asks her to buy one and bring it to Brightside. The message ends with ‘Don’t rip me off’. While trying to find an extractor, Danny inadvertently tells Harry Tungla that there was someone inside the box his trucker carried to the farm. The crew then decides to take CassianVireo with them to Brightside, for what she pays C2k. Flying off defiance is delayed in 4 days, due to weather. But even when the weather improves the Frostbreaker barely does it, with its fusion reactor shutting down due to load as the ship gains orbit. They dock the ship in a refuelling station in high orbit and get a new drone, and from there depart to Perdurabo Upon arriving in Brightside, the Doomborgs learn that Dutta has fallen ill, and RolandLomax is now in charge. It became useful that the crew had a night drinking with Lomax when they first arrived in Perdurabo. Lomax asks them to offboard the Frostbreaker and explains that in about 6 days a large haruna bank transport will arrive to carry the Novium ingots. A bank auditor will be on this ship, and Lomax intends to share the information he has about Dutta’s embezzlement. Lomax asks the Doomborgs to be around when this happens, to show strength against YashDutta’s faction on the station. Lomax also mentions that another tharsisMining ship (the Ore Voyager) recently refuelled in Brigthside, and the crew updates him that they also work for Tharsis. ‘Why is Tharsis Mining involved in finding alien artefacts?’. |400 The crew goes back to the ColdTomb to mine the mRNA-rich ice around the construction (that is now destroyed). Mining was a dangerous endeavour, where one drone and many ice cargoes were lost. Incidentally, the crab infestation in the ship attacks Danny while he is piloting, in one of the most critical moments: Olaf and Oni are on an EVA, while Bennet is monitoring the harness. Danny is alone in the bridge and tries to fight off the crabs. He was unsuccessful and falls with a mortal face wound when one of the crabs lands on his face. The other crew members rush back when they notice Danny screaming, and Olaf in a heroic save fends off multiple crabs while grappling an unconscious Danny. The Doomborgs are able to seal the crabs in the bridge and Bennet with his laser sharp medic skills is able to stabilise Danny - who looked dead already. After this accident, the crew decides to go back to Brightside with a partial load. They would come back later with someone skilled in piloting the drones. Upon arrival on Brightside, Danny is rushed into the infirmary. Olaf speaks with the doctor, SuyinIndrani, who supports Dutta and thinks Lomax has poisoned the director. She also shares that Lomax is not liked by his own employees. The personnel on the station start to go about quickly now, as the bank’s transport is arriving. Lomax is ready to share what he knows. 1.7 Chaos in Brightside Arrival of Sabaka The banker transport arrives and, while they wait and prepare to disembark, a burnt escape pod also arrives in the station. Inside the pod is Sabaka, unconscious. There is also a significant amount of transparent and reflective goo. A technician takes the goo to the station laboratory for study. Sakaba is taken to the infirmary, where they are evaluated. Oliver Bennet helps Dr SuyinIndrani and finds a metallic object inside Sabaka’s anus. Sabaka wakes up as the object is being removed. Olaf and Oni go to the Frostbreaker to study the egg like metallic object. Bennet stays in the infirmary with Sabaka and Danny, who were recovering from the PopperSwarm attack. Research the metallic egg and the alien language filmed. Oni and Olaf are in the Frostbreaker, and start researching the alien bas relief from the cold tomb, recorded on film month ago. Metallic egg Oni researches the egg. It is made of some unknown metal, with hardness 6.5 (slightly harder than a steel alloy) The egg does not crush when hit repeatedly with a hammer, but no further destructive tests were conducted. Film Bas relief is ritualistic in nature On the right side, multiple species are shown to be linked somehow. This can be an evolutionary link, a carrier link, some kind of multi symbiosis or maybe some hive mind. They do remind Earth animals somehow. On the left side, a technological insect humanoid species seems to control the other civilisation. They are clearly aliens to the beings on the right side. It seems that the approach taken by the insectoids is to swarm a civilisation and conquer. They are shown with weapons. As they look at the video, Olaf becomes very interested in the insectoid aliens and his mind is suddenly taken by the memories and emotions of his abduction decades ago. His mind rebuilds a perfect image of these aliens as Olaf starts to become anxious. Half a second later a flash of light is seen from one of the windows of the Frosbreaker, Olaf curls himself in the floor, repeating some kind of mantra. Oni looks at the windows and sees that some kind of explosion has happened on the high deck of Brigthside. Bombs in Brightside For those in Brigthside, a tremor is felt, and the alarm goes off first, then lights turn off, while emergency lights turn on. Bennet and Danny come down from the infirmary carrying Sabaka, to meet Olaf and Oni again on the cargo bay. The banker transport is preparing to depart, to avoid any kind of terrorist act that seems to be taking place in the station. As the belly of the ship is exposed, Olaf and Oni immediately notice some kind of explosive attached to the ship. Olaf rapidly informs this on open channel to the banker transport and 20 seconds later a escape pod leaves the ship. A second escape pod leaves a minute later. The transport does not explode, yet. Investigate Dutta’s documents Olaf speaks with RolandLomax and take the documentations that would expose Dutta from Roland’s hands. Roland is ok with it, feeling it is the best route of action. Oni quickly parse these documents and finds: Embezzlement of YashDutta, who stole money during the construction of Brightside, alonside the son of one of the private minor investors. Purchase orders from Recombination Group (logo) for shipment of Novium - which might explain the fact the the station was not meeting Haruna’s production quotas. MoU with makita’s subsidiary for ice mining rights - although the two companies are competitors and such an extraction agreement would not be allowed in the new space law from the ico. Repairs on the fusion reactor Oni and Bennet go to the high deck to help repair the fusion reactor. The core is not damaged, but most auxiliary systems are destroyed. It will take weeks, if not months, for a complete fix. A crew of technicians start the work. The Haruna Banker ElianaMurovec and her bodyguard leave the transport Olaf softly tells her of the documents the crew has in their possession. Eliana agrees to a private conversation inside her pod where Olaf shares what he knows, and the documentation that proves it. Eliana is flabbergast, and after thinking of her options, she offers to pay Olaf to take her back to TheSolomons. Olaf explains he needs to discuss it with his crew first, and leaves the pod. Conversation with CassianVireo Bennet finds Cassian again, in the midst of turmoil in the station. Cassian explain she has been working in the Midnight Sun bar, and wishes to go back and leave Brightside, as she is afraid of what is happening. Bennet promises to contact her again before they depart. Decisions The crew meets again in the cargo bay, and decide they will take the banker. Before they leave, Bennet, Danny and Sabaka go to the Midnight Sun bar and speak with MarionHardlee. Marion confirms Cassian was never an employee on the bar. The crew decides to leave her behind, and it would be too risky to confront her now. Bennet decides to inform the risk of Cassian to Roland, who becomes very unpleased. Roland demands that the Frosbreaker crew take Cassian back, if there is a risk she is the bomber. It was the Frostbreaker who brought Cassian to the station in the first place. The conversation does not go well, and it turns to violence. Bennet quickly stab Roland twice before Roland decides to give up this fight. Roland covers his wound, and decide to go to the infirmary. The crew discusses and decide it is best to leave Roland alive. They board Eliana in the Frostbreaker and depart the station. Leaving Perdurabo, and… The Frostbreaker scoops hydrogen fuel from the penumbra of The Beast and are ready to go. Around two days later, close to the edge of the Perdurabo system, something hard and heavy hits the Frostbreaker. Alarms go off: Mass centre of the ship has changed, something is attached to the Frostbreaker… There is an attempt to breach the hull… Nothing is seen, but the hull is cut open cold… A flap of the hull is pulled to the outside, opening a hole… The crew quickly move to the citadel of the ship once more. They take the metallic egg, inside a Faraday cage, with them. The rest of the ship looses pressure to space.

Requirements Degenesis Rebirth, which can be obtained at no cost from the Degenesis website: Primal Punk DR1 Katharsys DR2 The Metamorphica (Classic Edition), which can be acquired as pay-what-you-want MORPH Light and Dark Dice Characters With the other players, define a cohesive group concept. Always start with a Name and Archetype. Roll for Attributes and assign points. Roll for Grit and Ego. Choose one Advancement. A character sheet is available here. Archetypes You are defined by your Culture, Clan and Concept. Together they define your Archetype. The Archetype encapsulates your background, concept, role and community within the narrative. It should offer an immediate grasp of your identity and behaviours. It is expected you will evolve beyond your initial Archetype, towards unique narratives. DR2 34-41 Example: Who is Scuff Meet Scuff, our example character. Because the group is playing in the Balkan region, Scuff took that as a Culture. The group also agreed to play as a scouting detachment, and most of them are Clanners, although one is a Scraper - but not Scuff. Scuff is intended to be a believer in spirits, so their concept is that os a Zealot. Attributes and Saves There are \\(6\\) Attributes that you can use to overcome obstacles. Intuition: track targets, understand creatures, care, survive. Reason: concentrate, think abstractly, build knowledge. Finesse: dextrous manipulation, precision, subtle misdirection. Exertion: apply physical force and power, melee. Attunement: get in the flow and tune the arcane or technology. Influence: compel obedience, socialise, influence. Each Attribute has a rating (from \\(0\\) to \\(4\\)) that determine how many dice to roll when performing Risky Actions. On the character sheet, their ratings are read horizontally. Saves are groupings of two Attributes each. Insight/Evasion Save groups Intuition and Reason Attributes Prowess/Physical Save groups Finesse and Exertion Attributes Resolve/Mental Save groups Attunement and Influence Attributes Saves also have ratings (from \\(0\\) to \\(2\\)) that determine how many dice to roll in a Reaction situation. On the character sheet, their ratings are read vertically. Determine ratings For each Save grouping (Insight, Prowess, and Resolve) roll \\(1d\\) and consult the table below to determine how many rating points you have to distribute for each. \\(1:3\\) \\(4:5\\) \\(6\\) Rating points \\(1\\) \\(2\\) \\(3\\) In certain conditions, you might permanently lose ratings, this is discussed in other sections. Example: Scuff’s ratings Scuff has an Attunement Attribute rating of \\(3\\) (read horizontally). They roll \\(3d\\) when performing a Risky Action related to Attunement. They also have Influence \\(0\\) (horizontally), so they roll \\(0d\\) (i.e. no chance if no advantage is found). If their Resolve is challenged, they may roll a Reaction with \\(1d\\), based on their Resolve/Mental Save rating (read vertically). Grit &amp; Ego “It’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward” (Rocky Balboa) While Grit represents your physical and mental resistance, Ego represents your ability to keep pushing. Roll \\(1d\\) to determine your initial Grit maximum and initial Ego. Advancements and conditions may change the number of dice you roll. After a well fed and rested night, you recover \\(1d\\) of Grit lost, up to your maximum. You may choose to consume Primer spores (or drugs based on these spores) and roll to reset your Ego. You can keep the new value if it is higher than your current Ego. Ailments You lose Grit when you are mentally strained or physically harmed. When your Grit reaches \\(0\\) you are lost somehow. With the GM determine how your last scene goes. Anytime you are strained or harmed, you can choose to gain an Ailment instead of losing Grit. You have \\(3\\) Ailment tracks: Stressed (\\(-1d\\) Insight), Broken (\\(-1d\\) Prowess) and Weary (\\(-1d\\) Resolve). Each Ailment track recovers through appropriate care and a week of rest. If you mark all \\(3\\) Ailment tracks you fall unconscious. If you survive, you develop a malaise. Roll \\(1d\\) and consult the table below. With the GM, describe it narratively. A malaise never recovers. Malaises \\(1\\) Re-roll your Grit with \\(-1d\\) from now on. You die if it goes below \\(0d\\). \\(2\\) When you re-roll your Ego, use \\(-1d\\) from now on. You die if it goes below \\(0d\\). \\(3\\) \\(-1\\) Insight, you die if it goes below \\(0\\). \\(4\\) \\(-1\\) Resolve, you die if it goes below \\(0\\). \\(5\\) \\(-1\\) Prowess, you die if it goes below \\(0\\). \\(6\\) No malaise. Pushing yourself You spend Ego when you push beyond yourself in Risky Actions or use some character Advancements. When your Ego reaches \\(0\\) you are lost somehow. With the GM determine how your last scene goes. Example: Scuff’s scuffs Scuff has \\(1d\\) for both Grit and Ego (usual for early characters). They have seen some harm, having lost \\(3\\) Grit (from \\(5\\) to \\(2\\)) and taken a Hazed wound. This means that any time they roll related to Insight (Intuition or Reason for Risky Actions, or Evasion Reaction), they take \\(-1d\\). Scuff also risked their Ego a few times, and took Spores to reset it (from 2 to 4). They have taken a mutation, which is detailed as a Condition. Finally, they have gotten a malaise at some point, having reduced their Exertion Attribute rating because of a weak lower back. Advancements As you become more seasoned, you gain Advancements. You start the game with \\(1\\) Advancement. Many Advancements in this section are adaptations of Degenesis’ Potentials. These will be accompanied by book reference tags. For every session you play (and survive) you gain \\(+2\\) Experience. You also gain \\(+1\\) Experience for each new Condition you develop. Whenever it is narratively coherent, you may spend Experience equal to \\(2\\times\\) your current number of Advancements to gain a new one. As you do that, you may reset your Grit maximum. Roll your dice and keep the maximum between the current and the new Grit. Until you have \\(5\\) Advancements, you can only choose from your own Cult or from the common list. Common Asceticism You last twice as long without food or water. DR2 98 Bodyguard You can choose to take damage instead of one of your allies. Brainwave Roll Attunement. It you Succeed, you gain \\(+1d\\) when you try to find a solution to a problem, until the end of the scene. If you Fail, you become Hazed (Wound). DR2 98 Could be worse When Broken (Wound) you do not take the penalty of \\(-1d\\). DR2 99 Danger sense \\(+1d\\) whenever you use a Insight/Evasion Save. DR2 98-99 Developed Gain \\(1\\) in an Attribute. The maximum you can have in all Attributes together is \\(10\\). Die Hard When you reset your Grit maximum, roll \\(+1d\\) and sum all the dice you rolled. Eager When you reset your Ego, roll \\(+1d\\) and keep the highest. Elephant skin When unarmored your Armour is \\(1\\). DR2 98 Ether call \\(+1d\\) when interacting with other mutants (including combat). You must have at least \\(5\\) mutations to take this Advancement. DR2 98 Fast When you roll, your Effect is always applied first. Marathon \\(+1d\\) when running. DR2 99 Number cruncher \\(+1d\\) when using mathematics or logic. DR2 99 Sensory acuity You have \\(+1d\\) on noticing things through a chosen sense. Sleek \\(+1d\\) whenever you contort yourself to to break free. DR2 99 Specialist Choose a specific type of action. When you Fail it in a Risky Actions you still succeed, with Reduced Effect. For a list of specialisations, use Degenesis’ skills list. DR2 17-23 Unyielding When Weary (Wound) you do not take the penalty of \\(-1d\\). DR2 99 Whirlwind In combat, when you are successful, select an additional die as a second hit. Chroniclers Dead End \\(+1d\\) when attacking someone cornered. DR2 53 Download \\(+1d\\) when questioning a prisoner NPC. DR2 53 Fractal Memory \\(+1d\\) on memory related actions. DR2 53 Nova Roll Attunement. It you Succeed, cause blindness until the end of the scene. If you Fail, the suit power is depleted until the end of the scene. DR2 53 Tesla \\(+1d\\) when in close contact conflict. If you Fail, roll \\(2d\\) effect as you electrocute yourself. DR2 53 Upload \\(+1d\\) when trying to incept an idea on an NPC. DR2 53 Conditions Every time you consume Primer spores, you reset your Ego. This is the Primer slowly developing you towards the Homo Degenesis. Spores can be consumed directly from nature, or through drugs such as Burn. Every time you consume spores, make a Risky Action with \\(0d\\) (you may choose to risk Ego, as usual). Outcome \\(1:3\\) Condition: Roll a detrimental mutation. MORPH 127-129 \\(4:5\\) Condition: Roll a random (beneficial or detrimental) mutation. MORPH 124-129 \\(6\\) Condition: Roll a beneficial mutation. MORPH 124-127 If your Ego did not reach \\(0\\), roll your dice and take the highest to determine your reset Ego. Whenever your new Ego is lower than the current number of Conditions, you gain an Stigma Condition as well. DR2 With the GM, determine the mechanical effects of the new Condition you have, and how to introduce it into the narrative. Equipment With the GM define which tags, ranges and Effect are appropriate for your weapons. Weapons used outside their expected ranges roll with \\(-1d\\). The following short list of tags may be expanded with the GM. Versatile: \\(+1e\\) when held two-handed. Nimble: Effect is applied first. Slaughter: Effect die explode on \\(5+\\). Improvised: \\(-1d\\), \\(1e\\). Unhandy: \\(-1d\\) if used at Contact or Reach ranges. Weapon Effect Ranges Tags Notes Knife \\(2e\\) Contact Nimble Staff \\(2e\\) Contact; Reach - Primitive bow \\(3e\\) Nearby Unhandy Short sword \\(3e\\) Contact Versatile Long sword \\(4e\\) Contact Versatile Hunting rifle \\(5e\\) Nearby; Far Away - Armours act as buffers when you take damage from Challenges. Subtract the armour modifier from the Effect before reducing your Grit Armour Modifier Details Light \\(1\\) Heavy \\(2\\) \\(-1d\\) to run, observe, sneak, swim, etc. Shield \\(1\\) Can be sacrificed to completely avoid an Effect. Rules Risky Actions When you are trying your chances at a Risky Action, say what you intend to do. With the GM determine your appropriate Attribute or Save. Then gather 6-sided dice. Dice Pool Take a number of Light Dice equal to your applicable Attribute or Save. If you are in an advantageous or precarious position, the GM may give you \\(\\pm 1d\\). You must always roll between \\(0d\\) and \\(4d\\) Light Dice. Take as many Dark Dice as you wish to risk Ego for pushing yourself for a success. For each Dark Die that rolls equal or lower than your current Ego, decrease your Ego in one. Roll the dice and choose one die to be your Precision (generally the highest, but you might choose differently if you wish) and consult the table. Outcome \\(1:3\\) You Fail, and things get worse. With the GM describe the consequences. The GM may also allow you to succeed, but things will get worse in some other way. \\(4:5\\) You Succeed, but there’s some consequences. With the GM describe the complication and how you succeed. \\(6\\) You Succeed. With the GM describe what happens. Evaluate Effects as appropriate, if the Risky Action is part of a Challenge. Effects Effects determines the quantitative result of your Risky Actions towards overcoming Challenges. Examples of Effects are: Damage given, Convincing done, Distance covered, Weakness learned. When you roll your Risky Actions, choose one die to be your Effect (generally the second highest, if the highest was used as Precision). The Effect die is an exploding die (i.e. if the result is a \\(6\\), keep rolling and accumulating the result). The Effect you apply is never lower than the Effect Tier of your approach, regardless of the die outcome. Your Effect is subtracted from the Challenge Disposition. Tier Minimum Effect for \\(1e\\)Improvised Makeshift tool;Rock, pipe, punch. \\(2e\\)Reduced Primitive tool;Weak argumentKnife, staff \\(3e\\)Standard Fit for purpose tool;Good argument; Revolver, short sword \\(4e\\)Increased Expert grade tool;Strong rationale;Autofire pistol, SMG, shotgun, long sword \\(5e\\)Extreme Tech augmented expert grade tool;Rifle, axe, halberd Challenges Sometimes, multiple actions are required to overcome Challenges. Examples of Challenges are fighting an enemy, duelling rhetorically, negotiating an environment, crawling a location, journeying. Challenges have Disposition, which measures how much Effect they take to be overcame. Challenges also have Effect dice that are applied to you as consequences of your Risky Actions. Tier Disposition Effect Examples \\(0\\)Trivial \\(5\\) \\(d/2\\) Unskilled adversaries, low height climb, known journey \\(1\\)Dangerous \\(10\\) \\(1d\\) Skilled adversaries, small predator, large prey, troublesome journey \\(2\\)Serious \\(20\\) \\(2d\\) Expert adversaries, large predator, traverse fire or acid \\(3\\)Formidable \\(30\\) \\(3d\\) Human prime, apex predator, climbing the Everest \\(4\\)Exceptional \\(40+\\) \\(4d+\\) Transhuman, often fatal environments, heroic journeys Some challenges might be multifaceted. A bulky rival might be a Dangerous Challenge to fight against, but a Trivial Challenge to be convinced to ignore you. When Challenge Effects are applied to you narratively, use the table. Consequence \\(1:3\\) Something annoying happens. \\(4:5\\) Something troublesome happens. \\(6\\) Something devastating happens. When Challenge Effects are applied to you as damage your Grit might be reduced. Subtract the armour rating from the Effect, and then reduce the remainder from your Grit. You may choose to mark a Wound track instead of receiving damage. Magnitude Sometimes you and the GM might need to compare different dimensions of Magnitudes. Tier Area Party Duration Range Harm Severity \\(0\\)Poor Closet \\(1\\) person Moment Contact \\(d/2\\) Minor injury. Sprains and bruising. \\(1\\)Good Corner \\(3\\) people Scene Reach \\(1d\\) Bleeding cuts and broken bones. Small explosions. \\(2\\)Excellent Room \\(10\\) people Hour Nearby \\(2d\\) Close contact with bodily destructive phenomena (such as fire, explosions, or acid). \\(3\\)Impecable Wing \\(30\\) people Day Far away \\(3d\\) Large explosions. Immersive contact with fi re and acid. \\(4\\)Legendary Building \\(100\\) people Week Remote \\(4d\\) Usually fatal harm, often immediately. Fortune die When the GM wants to leave some decision to the dice, determine the chances and roll \\(1d\\). Sayonara At any moment you can decide it is your last scene. When you do that, re-roll your Ego and Grit, and keep the highest values. For this scene, you only expend Ego if you roll a \\(1\\). By the end of the scene, you have to figure out how you depart (death, madness, mission, etc.). You can create a new character with half (rounded up) the number of Advances the previous character had. Social contract Define a social contract on the first session, and review it anytime a new player joins the table. "],["to-kievs-south.html", "Spacetime 2 To Kiev’s South 2.1 Scouts departure Current map", " Spacetime 2 To Kiev’s South You are members of the hunter-gatherer clan known as the Vostok Kin, deeply connected to your land and traditions. Over the past decade, the relentless advance of the spore fields from the east of Pollen has placed your ancestral homeland in grave danger. The once plentiful taiga and tundra have become battlegrounds, threatened not only by the deadly spores but also by the encroaching Ironclaw Horde, led by the fearsome warlord Kargan the Bloodthirsty. The Lesnje, the whispering guardians of the woods, have grown increasingly aggressive, tipping the natural balance into chaos. Following a brutal Ironclaw raid that resulted in the abduction of five Vostok women, Elder Mirova calls for a council. The clan’s shamans, led by Yelena the Seer, have had disturbing visions of a cataclysmic future. The council places its hope in a perilous journey to find a new homeland. Rumours speak of a valley South of the ruins of Kiev where the Taiga is strong and rivers are clean. You have been chosen to be scouts on this endeavour, tasked with mapping the path to this promised land, seeking alliances with other clans and tribes along the way. But before the scouts departure, the tribe needs to make sure the Ironclaw does not pose significant threat to the remaining clanners. The first mission is to identify the Ironclaw’s hiding place, and gather with the other scouts 4 days later. The Vostok Kin Location Approximately 600 km east of the ruins of Kiev. Environment Tundra (and Taiga in the south), now increasingly encroached upon by spore fields from the east History The Vostok Kin trace their lineage back to survivors who fled eastward during the early days of the Eschaton. Initially, they found refuge in the dense forests and open steppes, where they developed a semi-nomadic lifestyle centred around hunting, foraging, and small-scale agriculture. Culture The Vostok Kin are a deeply spiritual people with a rich oral tradition. They believe their ancestors were guided by the spirits of the land to their current home, and they have a strong connection to nature. Their society is organised around extended family units, with elders holding significant influence. Spirituality They worship a pantheon of nature spirits, each associated with different aspects of their environment, such as whispers, weather and animals. Rites of Passage Important milestones in a Vostok Kin’s life are marked by elaborate ceremonies that often involve tests of skill and endurance. Includes the Rite of the Transcend Spore, when Primer Spores are consumed ritualistically. Conflict Resolution Disputes are settled through council meetings where elders mediate and seek the wisdom of the spirits. 2.1 Scouts departure Summary to be added after first session.

Players take on the roles of Vagabonds, individuals who have arrived in Nibiru with no memory of their past, and must explore the station and its bizarre societies to uncover their histories and the secrets of this enigmatic world. Themes Memory: The theme of memory is central, as characters struggle to piece together fragmented memories and uncover the truth about their pasts. Memory serves as both a tool and a barrier, shaping the characters’ identities and driving their actions as they explore the mysteries of the Nibiru. Identity: In a world where characters’ memories are unreliable and their true selves are often obscured, characters must navigate the complexities of identity, grappling with questions of who they are and who they want to become in the face of uncertainty and amnesia. Exploration: Characters’ journey through the vast and enigmatic space station known as the Nibiru. As they do, they uncover hidden secrets, encounter strange creatures, and navigate treacherous environments as they explore the depths of the ship and search for answers about its origins and purpose. Directory This reference document is focused on playing Nibiru on the chassis of Best Left Buried. This document is not intended to be self-contained, and requires other books. NBR: Nibiru Corebook (link to view-only pdf, audiobook and quick start pdf) BLB: Best Left Buried Zine Edition (link to download) System Best Left Buried (video review) emphasises a minimalist rule system designed to foster atmospheric horror and survival tension, prioritising player skill and strategic resource management over character abilities. The game stands out for its focus on the psychological impact of uncanny consequences, where the true enemy is often the fear and madness that comes from uncovering things that are, perhaps, Best Left Buried. Character creation Reference: Best Left Buried Zine 1 Habitat PCs têm um Habitat (NBR 127-147). Cada Habitat define regras específicas para a recuperação de Memórias e Revelações. Archetypes e Advancements do BLB não vão ser usados diretamente, apenas como inspiração (mecânica) para as Revelações do NBR. ##### Stats {-} Para a criação de personagens basta definir os atributos (Brawl, Wit, Will) e calcular Vigour e Grip. PCs start with: +2 in one stat, +1 to another and +0 to the last. PCs have two resource pools: Vigour and Grip. - Max Vigour is 6 + Brawl - Starting Grip is 4 + Will Advancements Memory Points (MP) são concedidos: - +3 base point per session - +1 if your PC has faced a dangerous situation Memos System Nibiru 112-113 Cada nova memória custa 5 MP. Memórias negativas concedem 5 MP ao PC. Memórias positivas concedem, na primeira ação relacionada à memória por cena, The Upper Hand para o Stat check. Por outro lado, memórias negativas concedem Against The Odds para o Stat check. ##### Revelations {-} Nibiru 115-119 Ao acumular 8 Memórias, o PC ganha uma Revelação. Ao ganhar a Revelação, os PCs também ganham 1 Vigour e Grip (efetivamente esse é o Level Up do Best Left Buried hackeado com o Nibiru). Alternativamente, o jogador pode discutir com o GM e escolher um Advancement do Best Left Buried. Regras The resolution mechanics of BLB is used, when not stated differently. Os Influence Points do NBR serão substituídos pelo Grip do BLB. Vigour recovery: - Base rate of one recovered Vigour per day. - It a PC does not have appropriate shelter, food or water, recovery is not possible. - If someone is treating the PC, one additional Vigour is recovered per day upon a successful Will check. The check is Against The Odds it there are no appropriate supplies or equipment. Consequences Reference: Best Left Buried Zine 5 Gaining consequences work the same way the do on BLB.

Por um dos lados eles seguem um túnel onde encontram algumas raposas bioelétricas. A alternativa é subir um poço, de onde um deles cai e falece. Os demais seguem em frente. Os Vagabonds encontram um altar de âmbar que é protegido por quatro esqueletos robóticos de metal e borracha. No mesmo local encontram Davi, acordando. Davi é um outro Vagabond, tambem com amnésia, e cego. Conan quase morre depois de um ataque de um dos esqueletos. O grupo retrata e prepara uma armadilha elétrica para dois dos robôs que os perseguem. Ambos caem na armadilha e morrem eletrocutados e pela queda. O último dos esqueletos não se moveu ainda, e continua localizado acima do altar, segurando uma espada. Zig laça o esqueleto e o arremessa em um poço próximo. O esqueleto cai, mas leva consigo a corda. Por um alçapão por cima da sala do altar de âmbar, que é quente ao toque, Robert encontra um antigo armorial. Nesse armorial, dentre vários equipamentos estragados e quebrados, ele separa duas lanças e uma pistola com 3 balas. Em seguida, na escuridão, o grupo se perde de Robert e Davi, mas decidem continuar adiante. Eles preparam mais cordas a partir de cabos e fios que encontram no local e descem mais um andar, em direção ao lugar em que o robô foi arremessado. No andar que inferior eles encontram uma estátua e uma poça de uma gosma alaranjada. Zig prova a gosma. No instante seguinte Zig pula com sua faca para cima de Elk, que rapidamente desvia e empurra Zig. Zig é infeliz e escorrega perto de um buraco, e cai, batendo nas paredes do túnel que segue para baixo, onde o robô caiu. Elk, desce até a metade do caminho onde Zig caiu. Zig parece morto, mas o grupo não confere para ter certeza. Eles decidem ir procurar o Coletor. Na sala onde estava o coletor, agora se encontra uma criatura que parece um insectoide bípede e muito ágil. Essa criatura emite uma leve luminescência azul. Com medo, o grupo tenta não enfrentar o inseto, movendo-se para outro lado nos túneis. Eles encontram o Coletor, que explica que esses insetos são perigosos. Num ato de bravura, o grupo afugenta o animal arremessando pedras e gritando. Após explorar mais um pouco, o grupo volta a sala do coletor, e oferecem os dedos que Conan tinha retirado do cadáver que encontraram há algumas horas. O Coletor fica satisfeito e entrega mais corda, um gancho e um pé-de-cabra para o grupo. O grupo finalmente encontra um local com água, e bebem desesperadamente. Percebem que também têm muita fome, e recuperam o cadáver de um dos lobos que tinham encontrado anteriormente. Usando o gancho, seus dentes e unhas, eles comem a carne do lobo. Com o gancho, corda e pé-de-cabra em mão, eles decidem tentar abrir a porta do alçapão superior, em direção à luz externa.

There was Guilf, a rugged bard with a quick wit; Miraak, an outcast dragonborn soldier; Kethra a young sorcerer with a mysterious past; Fuko a drow wizard from the Ghost Domain; and Dolman, a brave dwarven scout eager to prove himself. As they chatted, they heard of a large-scale attack of golden dragons in the south, causing widespread panic and chaos. The city of Watheton had no choice but to organise a mass evacuation to the nearby Tolfoddund mines. The group quickly offered to assist the Watheton leaders in ensuring safe passage for the inhabitants of the city. They scouted the road to the mines, fending off attacks from dangers along the way. Upon reaching the mines, the group discovered that their journey was far from over. A former friend of Guilf, Nilperto, had been turned into an undead creature, with a strange tattoo on his neck. The group fought bravely against Nilperto and his minions, eventually defeating them and uncovering a hidden passage that led to the Intermine and further to the Nargun Mines. 4.2 Chapter 2 The Glasrath alliance As the group emerged from the Intermine, they found themselves on the outskirts of the Nargun stronghold. The dwarves, who had been battling undead attackers for years, welcomed them with open arms. Over the next few weeks, many other people came to the mines seeking protection. Populations and armies from the cities to the south of Watheton, as well as drows from the Ghost Domain, arrived seeking shelter. Some of the refugees from the cities had actually seen the dragons, offering a varied description of their appearance and abilities. Some said they had never seen anything like them before, while others claimed they had fought dragons in the past, but never ones as these. As tensions rose, the leaders of the various groups appointed the group of five as their representatives. They were tasked with forming an alliance amongst all the armies in order to stand a chance against the approaching horde of undead. In the midst of this chaos, the group met Ghuse, a martial cleric from Algath, the goddess of life and death. As they worked to unite the disparate forces, the group learned more about the strange tattoo on Nilperto’s neck. They discovered that it was a mark of the undead army, a sign of their allegiance to a powerful necromancer who was rumoured to be behind the attacks. With the clock ticking down and the undead army approaching, the group worked tirelessly to coordinate the defences of the mines. They organised the various armies into a cohesive unit, using their unique skills and talents to prepare and equip them for battle. They knew that the battle ahead would be brutal and bloody, but they also knew that they had a chance to turn the tide and protect the innocent people under their care. 4.3 Chapter 3 Battle from Ammuinoth The Glasrath Alliance now faces a horde of undead marching from the Ammuinoth. The battle starts, and three clashes happen in the mines. Miraak is killed, but was lucky enough to be close to Ghuse who starts a long ritual to resurrect him. Fuko also falls in battle, but she is unlucky to sink in the lake, only to be found too late. In the end, the alliance is victorious, but not without many casualties - including the wyrmling gold dragon that was freed by the Glasrath Defenders (the name given to Miraak, Guilf, Kethra, Dolman, and the now deceased Fuko). Access to the city of Khatdzig is established again. The group is celebrated as heroes, and their names are forever etched in the history of these mines. They have faced insurmountable odds and emerged victorious, proving that even in the darkest of times, there is still hope.

With the goal of investigating the disappearance of the Gaelire Beikae, the Shield of Beauty, and her Paragon Force - which supposedly came to the Holzander burnt castle 10 years ago - the Glasrath Defenders went into the Ammuinoth. In the Castle of Bells they’ve met Weldon, a very pleasant werebear and then, in the Ardismouth Temple, they fought Tekerluth (who told them she was pregnant from Miraak).

The Defenders clashed with the beast, their weapons and spells piercing its ethereal form. After a brief rest to recover from their wounds, the group pressed on towards the castle. The sight that greeted them was one of destruction and decay. The walls had crumbled and the once-proud turrets were mere ruins. Strange feathery creatures seem to have taken lair in the broken battlements, but none were there while the Defenders entered. As they searched for a way inside, they discovered a hole in the underkeep that led to the castle’s subterranean depths. The group cautiously descended the rickety wooden staircase, the air thick with the stench of bird droppings and decay. At the bottom of the stairs, they stood at the entrance to a dimly-lit chamber. With weapons at the ready, they stepped forward into the unknown, prepared to face whatever terrors awaited them in the depths of the ruined castle. 5.3 Chapter 6 The torturer of Holzander 3877.5B, summer The Glasrath Defenders entered the first level of Holzander’s castle, and saw psychotic scenes of torture and death. They met the responsible for them - a torturer known as the Gaoler - who threw in disturbing comments about having tortured Gaelira and killed the Paragon Force. The defenders decided it was too much of it and went on to kill the Gaoler - who had support from animated torture equipment and zombies. The battle that followed was challenging and some of the defenders were significantly hit. Especially Miraak who, during combat, realised he was not really brought back to life by Ghuse, but has been reanimated as an intelligent undead. After killing the Gaoler, the defenders continued exploring the rooms and found two prisoners and their detainer, an ogre called Scar. The prisoners were Dugan Lovay - a dust elf merchant from the Linhe cities -, her companion, the Red Heart, and a halfling scholar from the capital Throta (in the northwest), who has been researching a disease known as the Lady Scurvy. The disease is some kind of death lycanthropy, but with very different consequences, that started afflicting the region about a year ago. Scar, the ogre, did not pose a threat to the defenders, and was very relieved that the Gaoler was finally dead. While talking with the prisoners, the group became aware of a magic Mystra’s door, through the catacombs, that goes into the surface (probably the lost access to the castle), and that the Gaoler knew the password to open it. Amyria also knows that this password is available in a book in Mystra’s temple’s library. In this first level, several monuments existed: a frog statue of a long lost deity, a bowman statue, representing Cauchurn in the death river, and a memorial to the first Holzander, who established the castle, and explored the Brezal Paths that are so rich in the area. The group then decided to venture towards the catacombs, where they met Ushulx, a cultist of Cauchurn. Ushulx partnered with them while they fought shadows coming from the catacombs to the east and south. Everyone was too hurt to continue after, and the party decided to rest in the cells, together with the prisoners and Ushulx, while Scar kept a look for them. 5.4 Chapter 7 The Void claim 3877.5B, summer After a much-needed rest, the defenders huddled together in a dimly lit cell, sharing their knowledge and plans. Amidst the whispers, Ushulx, Durgan, Red Hart, and Ichbon discussed the animosity between Algath and Charon, two deities from the Deadecho. They also revealed the presence of other formidable residents in the castle, such as Cagoth-ze, a master of time magic, Danaska, an expert in oozes, and the powerful beings Imortra and Gellert. Ushulx expressed her eagerness to locate Avrindt, the Creep, a red dragon rumoured to have transformed into a death dragon. Meanwhile, Ichbon shared his quest to find a long-lost elven library that may hold knowledge about the Lady Scurvy disease. The party engaged in a spirited debate about their next move, eventually deciding to venture to the lower level in search of Cagoth-ze. As they explored the second level, they stumbled upon records detailing gruesome ooze experiments and encountered a dangerous trap in the form of a green ink-ooze. Just moments later, Amirya’s sharp eyes spotted something extraordinary—a time tributary, a river of time flowing through one of the rooms. In a bold and impulsive act, Guilf stepped forward and crossed the tributary, only to fall unconscious and undergo a magical transformation, becoming significantly younger. It became apparent that Guilf had been claimed by The Void, bound to a contract with this mysterious entity. As the party deliberated their next steps, they noticed a clockwork servant skulking around the rooms, raising concerns about their safety. Acting swiftly, the group retreated from the second level and sought refuge in the safety of the cells on the first level, strategising their approach and considering the implications of Guilf’s newfound contract with The Void. 5.5 Chapter 8 First sight of Lady Scurvy 3877.5B3, summer With their strength waning and their wounds still fresh, the band of weary heroes embarked on a treacherous journey towards the revered temple of Mystra, their priorities aligned with rejuvenation and restoration. As they traversed the Ammuinoth, their footsteps weighed heavily while caring their wounded. It was during this perilous expedition that their eyes fell upon a grotesque sight—a creature, contorted and abominable, crawling with malevolence along the ceiling. Ichbon recognised the fiendish being as an unfortunate victim infected by the accursed Lady Scurvy disease. Miraak, ever vigilant, discerned disturbing similarities between the creature’s combat tactics and the vile vampire spawns employed by the armies of D’Elsin during the savage southern war. A battle ensued, arduous and fraught with peril, but it culminated in a final, decisive blow dealt by Kethra. Days later, they reached the temple and met an old acquaintance of Amyria’s, Jandar from the Desolate Flats, who informed them of undead ravaging Linhe. The FFKA, stalwart guardians of this strategic territory, had valiantly stood against the encroaching darkness. He was astonished as he discovered that the presumed fallen Glasrath Defenders still clung to life, offering their aid to the beleaguered region. Rested, they headed to Gimorkoc, facing a rare thunderstorm. The storm, as abruptly as it had materialised, eventually receded. A Rurkinar ritual, an esoteric ceremony seldom witnessed, was poised to commence, orchestrated by the cultists’ enigmatic high shaman. Their aim? To establish communion with the Angel Hound, a being of enigmatic power and purpose. Yet, amidst the gathering darkness and whispered incantations, Guilf, beset by a profound sense of disquiet, caught sight of a face within the throng—a visage hauntingly familiar, the countenance of his long-lost mother. Driven by an irresistible force, he chased after her, his companions hot on his heels. 5.6 Chapter 9 The Rurkinar ritual 3877.5F6, summer The valiant champions pursued Guilf’s enigmatic mother. Yet, as they delved deeper into the unfathomable abyss of her powers, their fortitude waned, and their resolute spirits trembled. Guilf’s mother possessed an indomitable mastery of Theurgy, a formidable force that unleashed abominations that sent shivers crawling along their spines, freezing their very souls. Reluctantly, the group retraced their steps to the central square, drenched in a torrential downpour and an ethereal glow emanating from the ancient temple stones. The ritual to commune with the dreaded Angel Hound was underway. The air grew thick with anticipation as the incantations surged and chaos erupted, a violent upheaval that seized the cultists with ferocious might, wrenching them away to the somber castle ward under the merciless grip of the FFKA. Undeterred by the dark turn of events, the heroes, cloaked in the veils of night, ventured into the shadowed heart of the castle ward. It was Guilf, his heart filled with courage and empathy, who dared to breach the psychic barriers of the Rurkinar Shaman. The long-awaited culmination of the ritual revealed the prison that ensnared the Angel Hound - the enigmatic Holzander Castle. The Shaman’s arduous work had reached its fateful conclusion. With the dawning of the morrow came the arrival of General Sergarus—a figurehead both dreaded and revered in Linhe. It was Sergarus who extended his impenetrable hand, granting clemency to the cultists detained in the night’s embrace, save for the Shaman. In a damning judgment of treason, the Shaman was sentenced to the ghastly fate of impalement. Two hours later, under the watchful gaze of the village, the order was carried out by an FFKA knight with merciless precision. 5.7 Chapter 10 Desert road 3877.6A6, autumn The party became aware that the Faithful Faletist Knights of the Arch (FFKA) marked them as a group consisting of two adults, two children, and one old brute - an unconventional combination that added an air of mystery to their reputation. As the heroes delved deeper into the mysteries of the land, they discovered that the thunderstorms in the region of Linhe had grown increasingly frequent and perilous. Prayers to Rurkinar, the Brown Eagle god, had fallen upon deaf ears, leaving the land vulnerable to the raging storms that now wreaked havoc upon the countryside. This disquieting revelation hinted at a growing imbalance in the forces that governed the realm. Undeterred by these challenges, the group forged ahead, deciding to make their way towards Eyaram, where they would assess their options for reaching the Holzander castle from the desert. However, their plans took an unexpected turn when a scout arrived from the east, bearing troubling news. Another horde of undead had launched an attack on the countryside, specifically targeting the lands east of Eyaram. A detachment of the FFKA was dispatched to gather more information, while their commander, Sergarus, remained stationed in Gimorkoc. The journey towards Eyaram commenced, and for the first two days, the group’s path remained uneventful, save for the peculiar sight of ancient organic structures that hinted at a forgotten past predating recorded history. On the third day, they found themselves navigating a treacherous gorge, realising that descending into its depths would render them vulnerable to unseen dangers. Opting for a safer route around the cliff, fate interceded in the form of a solitary figure - a protector of the road and an outcast of the Nurderad dragonborn known as Gulthas Morseth. Gulthas bore a burdened past, having been a participant in the raid of the mines under the influence of the battlemage Grezar. Near death’s door, Gulthas uncovered the true nature of his tormentor - a shadow dragon in disguise. The revelation struck a chord with Amyria, who recognised the description of the shadow dragon from ancient lore. These creatures had long dwelled deep within the Earth, slumbering for ages. They had departed from the material world, received by Algath’s blessings, only to return with nefarious intentions. Parting ways with Gulthas, the group continued their journey towards the ruined Temple of Remains. There, they engaged in skirmishes with weakened undead adversaries, their collective strength proving superior in combat. Kethra’s devastating power nearly laid waste to the entire ruin, but amid the chaos, a discovery awaited them—a tight, cold, and ominously glowing dark red tunnel that seemed to descend into the depths, perhaps leading to the enigmatic Ophaire. Amyria, channeling the divine might of her goddess Mystra, unleashed a wave of holy energy that obliterated seven undead creatures with a mere sight. The potency of her connection to Mystra became evident, further solidifying her status as a beacon of divine power within the group. As they navigated the Temple of Remains, they unraveled its past purpose - a prison once held captive Algath, the goddess of death herself. The remnants of the ancient power that had resided within its walls left a haunting imprint, a reminder of the forces that once shaped the land. With caution and wisdom, the party decided to explore other areas of the ruined temple, aware that each step took them deeper into the heart of darkness that permeated the land. Uncertainty loomed over them, but their resilience and determination remained unwavering as they braced themselves for the secrets yet to be unveiled within the Temple of Remains. 5.8 Chapter 11 Aivridyt’s past 3877.6B4, autumn In the grim depths of the Temple of Remains, the group of broken heroes came to a startling realisation - the tumultuous skirmish they had ignited upon their arrival had awoken other malevolent entities that lurked within the ancient halls dedicated to the death goddess. No sooner had the group taken a defensive stance than they found themselves cornered by two Blessed Dead Adepts, abominations that wielded an unholy mastery over the forces of death. These dark necromancers were accompanied by their grotesque minions, the slave husks—twisted, pitiful figures bound to their malevolent will. The direst of all was the zombie clot, a monstrous amalgamation of hundreds of decaying bodies, writhing and pulsating with an insatiable hunger for flesh. Desperation filled the air as the group fought fiercely against their relentless adversaries. In the midst of the chaotic battle, Kethra, once again facing the clutches of death, found herself almost consumed by the ravenous corpses. Salvation came in the form of Guilf, whose quick thinking conjured a shroud of magical darkness, enveloping the battlefield and granting Kethra a slim chance of escape. The following day, they took a moment to gather themselves and explored the remaining recesses of the ruined temple. Amidst the hundreds of tombs that lined the halls, their eyes fell upon four imposing statues and a tome written in the ancient draconic script. Two of the statues bore a chilling familiarity - Ghuse and Grezar, names that resonated with historical significance. However, the inscriptions on the statues hinted at a disquieting revelation - the beings masquerading as Ghuse and Grezar were mere facades, vessels assumed by none other than Aivridyt herself, carrying out her sinister machinations. The depths of her treachery were only beginning to reveal themselves. Leaving the temple behind, the group continued their arduous journey along the desert road. Soon, they encountered a sight both awe-inspiring and foreboding: a towering, ancient metal statue. Filled with a childlike curiosity, Guilf, unable to resist its allure, decided to perch within the statue’s mouth, immediately succumbing to a reverie that transcended mortal understanding. He found himself in communion with Mondendovil, the Ngar’tho Void - an ancient deity of the depths. Mondendovil spoke of the colossal statue as his long-lost physical form, and conveyed a chilling prophecy - the time for his return drew near. His devoted servants would soon arrive to reconnect his powerful mind with his formidable body, a union that would reshape the very fabric of existence. The implications of this encounter sent shivers coursing through the group’s spines, stirring a profound urgency within their hearts. Reluctantly leaving the enigmatic statue behind, the group pressed on, their sense of purpose heightened. The road led them to the Dwarf enclave of Durnum, where they sought respite and replenishment, even as the weight of their impending destiny hung heavily upon their shoulders. 5.9 Dramatis Personae: Aivridyt, the Creep Also known as: The Purple Evil, Ghuse, Grezar and other names In the shadowed annals of time, Aivridyt, once a small and ferocious female red dragon known as the Creep, ruled with a malevolence that sent shivers coursing through the Naragzah mountains. This fearsome creature, driven by a sinister curiosity, delved ever deeper into the labyrinthine caverns that lay beneath, venturing into the sacred mines of the two dwarven clans that called those depths their domain. The encounters with the Creep became a recurring nightmare for the Tolfoddund and Nargun warriors, who suffered greatly at her wrathful claws. It was in the year 3856 NC, amidst the blood-soaked peaks of the mountains, that an alliance was forged between the battered clans. United, they struck a grievous blow, leaving Aivridyt wounded and retreating into the dark recesses below. Humbled and wounded, the Creep sought solace in the unfathomable depths of the Ghost Domain. For six long years, she slumbered, her formidable essence cocooned in the embrace of darkness. Unbeknownst to her, during her deep slumber, a passage opened, beckoning her to the eerie realm known as the Dead Echo. Aivridyt was ensnared by its tendrils, and when she awoke, her once-vibrant scales had transmuted into a twisted shadow red, its hues akin to that of viscous petroleum, intertwined with accents of haunting purple. The Creep had become the Purple Evil—a creature steeped in darkness and corruption. To her dismay, the Purple Evil discovered that she had come to bear eggs, a phenomenon unheard of in the annals of draconic lore for millennia. Her progeny’s arrival was an unexpected twist of fate, and she laid the eggs in a cavernous lair, inadvertently attracting the attention of a destitute family dwelling perilously close to the mountains. Swift and merciless, the Purple Evil dispatched the parents, but she saw potential in the seven-year-old child, Kethra Stormwind. Cunningly, she donned the guise of a gentle sage, veiling her true nature beneath a veneer of wisdom and compassion. Kethra was ensnared in a perpetual state of drowsiness, ensorcelled by the Purple Evil’s potent magic and elixirs, deceived into believing she was raised by the sage in her humble abode. The Purple Evil harboured no clear plans for the child, and her careless machinations led to an unforeseen turn of events. Kethra, awakening from her prolonged stupor, escaped the clutches of the lair, leaving behind the twisted enchantments that had held her captive. In her insatiable hunger for power, Aivridyt, assuming the guise of Ghuse, a human guard captain and cleric devoted to Algath, the goddess of life and death, plotted her ascent in the city of Gorthugke. From the shadows, she manipulated her way to the pinnacle of military command, her influence spreading like a dark stain across the region. In tandem, she concocted a macabre alliance with Grezar, a necromancer dwelling among the dragonborn of Nurderad. The nefarious Grezar orchestrated a vengeful assault upon the Tolfoddund dwarves, reaping havoc upon their land—a cruel act of retribution for the Creep’s past transgressions. It was also Grezar that, years before, sent Miraak much too young to battle, where his body and soul burned, becoming a faint memory of a once fearless dragonborn warrior. 5.10 Interlude: A dream of Makab In the depths of their wearied minds, some of the Glasrath defenders share a nightmare, one that plagued their restless slumber. This nightmarish vision transported them to an ancient temple shrouded in the mists of the sea - a place of forgotten rituals and unspeakable horrors. Within the dream, they found themselves thrust into the midst of a sinister ceremony, their presence intended to thwart the unfolding ritual. Yet, as the dream progressed, a chilling realisation dawned upon them - the Glasrath defenders themselves were integral to the very ritual they sought to disrupt. Their every action, their every step, was predetermined, inexorably woven into this malevolent enchantment. Enigmatic beings, known as Ngar’thos, stood as mere witnesses, their forms twisted and alien, indifferent to the mortals’ plight. And at the centre of it all stood the Eldritch Furnace, a conduit to realms unimaginable, where Ethux’zhurh, an embodiment of The Void, awaited its unwitting prey. As the dream neared its crescendo, Kimbarak, driven by desperation and armed with a golden dagger, believed it to be his salvation - a weapon that could sever the grasp of The Void and restore balance. But the cruel irony of the nightmare unfolded before their eyes. As Kimbarak raised the dagger, it was not The Void that was halted, but Kimbarak himself who became ensnared within the swirling tapestry of reality, forever condemned to serve as a slave spirit to the ancient horrors that lurked beyond. With despair gnawing at their hearts, the remaining defenders made a fateful decision - to flee the accursed temple and escape the clutches of Ethux’zhurh. Their footsteps echoed through the corridors and inhumane rooms, a desperate bid for survival. Yet, Guilf’s dream diverged from the others, his nightmare ending with a chilling embrace by The Void itself, an all-encompassing darkness that dragged him relentlessly into the unfathomable depths of the sea. Miraculously, the surviving defenders, in a stroke of sheer luck, managed to sail away from the awakening Ethux’zhurh, evading its wrath and preserving their tenuous hold on existence. 5.11 Chapter 12 Finding Holzander once more In the shadowed enclave of Durnum, the broken Glasrath defenders sought refuge among the stoic dwarves, their journey fraught with despair and uncertainty. Amyria, ever the beacon of compassion, extended a benevolent hand to the famine-stricken dwarves. Her words promised respite from the relentless Dust Elf traders who, under the merciless rule of Neeleu, demanded burdensome tributes. As the heroes conversed with Glorizerlug Chaosfoot, the dwarven elder revealed the secrets of Durnum’s origins. The mining enclave had been hewn from the very bedrock of an ancient construction shaft, a subterranean passageway that linked to the tunnels of Ammuinoth. From the lips of Chaosfoot, they learned of the grim state of affairs in the southern realms, a harrowing tale of defeat and despair that had driven the Kiranu dwarves to forsake their mountain abodes. Their desperate exodus northward had been shielded by the stalwart Nurderad Dragonborn, but the heroes’ hearts grew heavy with dread. In the midst of their deliberations, Dolman’s heart wrestled with a terrible choice. His Kirano kin, vulnerable and threatened, called out to him from the south. Yet, the enigmatic secrets of Holzander Castle where his mother has been lost a decade ago. A heavy silence hung over the party as they made their fateful decision to press onward to the castle, hearts heavy with the weight of unresolved choices. It was Guilf, his mind forged in the fires of bardic curiosity, who delved into the thoughts of the dwarves. Through their collective memory, he gleaned the knowledge they sought—the hidden path to Holzander Castle, an invaluable revelation that saved them precious hours of fruitless searching in the unforgiving desert. With resolve renewed, the broken heroes embarked on the desert trail, their passage serene until they reached the ancient ruins of Dannamore. Here, beneath a tumultuous thunderstorm that cast jagged forks of lightning across the heavens, they found themselves pursued by a vengeful storm spirit, a tempest incarnate. Within the crumbling confines of Dannamore’s ruins, the weary travelers stumbled upon an unexpected encounter—a band of Anak Warriors, also fleeing the encroaching southern conflict. In a tragic twist of fate, Kethra, her instincts awry, launched a fateful assault upon the unsuspecting Anaks. The ensuing clash was fierce and sorrowful, and amidst the chaos, Miraak fell upon the cold stonefrom a grievous wound inflicted by a nimble Anak hidden in the ruins. In the end, the broken heroes emerged victorious, yet the taste of innocent blood upon their hands was a bitter and haunting reminder of their choices. Amidst these tumultuous events, Guilf seized another chance to commune with The Void, an entity that loomed over him like a shadowy spectre. The revelation struck like a thunderbolt—Guilf’s very soul had been pledged to this malevolent force, a debt owed by his own mother in a dark covenant of ages past. Now, within the ominous embrace of Holzander Castle, the broken heroes stood at a crossroads of destiny, their past and future intertwined in the eldritch tapestry of fate. 5.12 Chapter 13 The Ancient Elven Library In the labyrinthine depths of Holzander Castle, the broken heroes found themselves enmeshed in a web of arcane intrigue. Danaska, the scholarly seeker of forbidden knowledge, had a request—a sinister task she desired accomplished. She wished for Cagoth-Ze, a master of time manipulation and a rival scholar, to be removed from the equation. The heroes, their spirits burdened by the enigma of the castle, were hesitant to oblige. Their path diverged, leading them to Cagoth-Ze’s chamber, where they learned of the mage’s own desire to eliminate Danaska. Once again, the group declined the call to violence. Cagoth-Ze, however, was not to be deterred. The master of time offered an alternative proposal—an arrangement in which the group would eliminate the imprisoned Ngar’tho within the summoning circle. But the heroes, weary of treacherous bargains and the siren call of dark deeds, once more turned down the offer. Thus, they ventured into the presence of the imprisoned Ngar’tho, an ancient entity yearning for freedom. It sought nothing but release, offering valuable information in return for its emancipation. In the end, the broken heroes struck a bargain with the Ngar’tho, a pact sealed with knowledge and secrets. The entity divulged the whereabouts of Galiera, held captive on the castle’s elusive third level by the Blighted, a race ensnared by the malevolent Gellert. Furthermore, it unveiled the cryptic path to the hidden library, concealed within the tapestry of time itself. With the Ngar’tho liberated, Cagoth-Ze believed the heroes had fulfilled their part of the bargain and welcomed them into his realm within the castle’s second level. There, they encountered a time construct, a paradoxical creation that would transport them through the temporal currents to the fabled library. The journey through the ever-shifting tides of time was a disorienting and surreal experience. The heroes glimpsed fleeting imprints of the world’s past and future, each image a fleeting echo of reality, each moment pregnant with foreboding. After hours spent within the library, delving into tomes of arcane wisdom and timeless mysteries, the heroes returned to their present time with the time construct. It was at this pivotal juncture that the group found itself divided, their destinies pulling them in disparate directions. Dolman, Guilf, and Amyria were resolute in their quest to rescue Galiera from the clutches of the Blighted on the third level. Meanwhile, Miraak and Kethra, their hearts aflame with the burning desire for justice and retribution, chose to confront Ghuse, the dark puppeteer who had manipulated their fates. With heartfelt farewells and whispered hopes of reunification in the uncertain future, the heroes embarked on their divergent paths within the enigmatic depths of Holzander Castle. 5.13 Chapters 14 &amp; 15: The Deepfolk In the shadowed depths of Holzander Castle, the Glasrath champions pressed forward into the foreboding third level, their path fraught with peril and uncertainty. Before they embarked on this treacherous journey, Cagoth-Ze, the time arcanist, bestowed upon them an unexpected gift—an ancient construct known as Brilhorte 3000. Cagoth-Ze explained that Brilhorte 3000 had been a steadfast guardian in his own trials and tribulations, a stalwart companion to guide them through the labyrinthine darkness of the castle. The heroes welcomed their new mechanical ally with gratitude and camaraderie, their party now augmented by this enigmatic presence. With introductions exchanged and Brilhorte 3000 by their side, the champions descended the stairwell leading deeper into the abyss of the third level. The landing was shrouded in impenetrable darkness, an eerie silence clinging to the air, broken only by faint, disquieting footsteps that hinted at the presence of hidden horrors. Guilf, ever perceptive, caught sight of Deepfolk warriors through narrow arrow slits in a dimly lit corridor to the south. They were positioned strategically, ready to unleash their deadly arrows upon any intruders. A sudden and treacherous turn of events revealed itself as Brilhorte, acting upon some capricious twist of fate, unwittingly triggered a trap. The south door creaked open, and a merciless iron gate descended behind the heroes, locking them in a perilous bottleneck. The Deepfolk warriors, trained to precision and armed with fearsome giant sword spiders, converged upon the heroes from all directions. Brilhorte, inexplicably, shifted into a dormant, inactive form—a twist of fate forewarned by Cagoth-Ze. What ensued was a relentless and protracted battle, an unyielding clash of wills and steel. Amyria, Dolman, and Guilf fought valiantly, dispatching many of their adversaries, but the Deepfolk, their numbers vast and their tactics cunning, gradually drove the heroes into a dire predicament, cornering them at the entrance to the third level. In a desperate gambit, Guilf conceived a daring plan. He would approach the Deepfolk alone, with Amyria and Dolman concealed. He would declare himself to be Imortra’s son and offer himself willingly. Miraculously, the audacious ploy succeeded, and Bjrnyar, the leader of the Deepfolk, agreed to take Guilf captive, instructing his comrades to hunt down and eliminate the other intruders. Meanwhile, Amyria, Dolman, and the now reactivated Brilhorte prepared an ambush for the two Deepfolk warriors hot on their trail. In a swift and brutal skirmish, they felled their foes, ensuring that the pursuit ended in their favor. Guilf, despite being in Bjrnyar’s grasp, managed to break free just moments before the Deepfolk were to hand him over to their comrades. Bjrnyar, determined not to let his quarry escape, commanded the Deepfolk Shaman unit to join the fray once more, while he pursued Guilf with relentless resolve. Brilhorte, once again dormant, lay inert. The Glasrath champions, acting swiftly and decisively, fled from the approaching Deepfolk. Their efforts to evade their pursuers proved futile, as the Deepfolk detected their presence in the landing room, the very place where the Ngar’tho had been imprisoned. Another frantic and harrowing battle erupted, culminating in one of the Deepfolk warriors fleeing in terror. However, the situation escalated as the heavy Deepfolk Shaman unit ascended the stairs, their ominous march resonating with a cacophony of armoured boots against the stone steps. Desperate to escape, the heroes sought refuge aboveground, arriving at the same level where they had last encountered Ushulx. What they beheld there was a scene of profound anguish—Scar, the ogre who had allied with them, lay sacrificed by Ushulx’s cruel hands. In that heart-wrenching moment, the champions vowed to exact vengeance upon Ushulx when they crossed her path again. As they ventured back to the first level of the castle, they were met with a disconcerting sight—undead entities flickered in and out of reality, a haunting manifestation that defied the boundaries of the living and the dead. Summoning their resolve, the heroes made a courageous decision—to return to the second level of the castle and investigate the Deepfolk unit they had left behind. There, they found Cagoth-Ze, coerced and threatened by Bjrnyar to serve as an informant for the Deepfolk, should the heroes dare to return. Yet, Bjrnyar had not anticipated Guilf’s ability to communicate telepathically with Cagoth-Ze. The gnome mage revealed the positions of the Deepfolk within the library, granting the champions a strategic advantage. With this newfound knowledge, Dolman, Amyria, and Guilf laid an ambush for Bjrnyar and his companions. In a swift and decisive strike, Dolman’s Halberd cleaved through the Deepfolk war leader’s armour with deadly precision, ending his life in a cataclysmic stroke. The remaining Deepfolk, still unaware of their impending doom, combed through the level in search of the heroes who had eluded them. Unbeknownst to them, the champions had already ascended to the surface, seeking refuge in the desolate Dannamore Hold. Outside the castle, an ominous sight awaited them—a colossal umbilical of energy connected the fortress to the heavens, its ominous significance shrouded in darkness. On their journey to Eyaram, the heroes encountered a group of Mercian commoners who spoke of the prophecy of Ethux’zhurh’s awakening, drawing many to Linhe. They described a dreadful spectacle—a gaping black fracture tearing through the heart of the desert. Amyria, Dolman, and Guilf resolved to protect the commoners on their path to Eyaram. But as they neared their destination, the night bore witness to the chilling manifestation of the commoners’ fears—an otherworldly fracture in reality, from which three reality-flickering spiders emerged, their presence heralding an imminent and indescribable terror. 5.14 Chapter 16: Madness in Eyaram In the ever-twisting labyrinth of their perilous journey, the beleaguered Glasrath champions found themselves ensnared in yet another malevolent embrace, their battle-worn bodies craving only the respite of the Fort City of Eyaram. But it was not to be so simple, for even in the supposed stronghold city, the tendrils of an insidious presence reached out to bind their minds. The city’s twisted streets, warped by hallucinations spawned from the darkest corners of the unknown, unfolded before them. Deja vu gripped their thoughts like the gnarled fingers of some eldritch puppeteer, and the very angles of construction defied the laws of reason. Laughter, high-pitched and maddening, echoed through the alleys, sung by spectral children who should never exist. Days slipped by like phantoms, and Amyria, ever the beacon of insight, slowly unraveled the nightmarish tapestry that enshrouded them. It was a Ngar’tho, those mind-warping entities, whose invisible hands pulled the strings of their torment. In an audacious gambit, Guilf ventured to interrogate their elusive tormentor. The words echoed in the hollow chasms of their consciousness, seeking answers within the dark recesses of the Ngar’tho’s enigmatic intentions. Why had they been chosen as playthings for this malevolent entity’s cruel games? The response, whispered through the abyss of thought, was chilling in its simplicity: Ethux’zhurh was poised to unveil its terrible pronouncements to all. The plight of the inhabitants of Linhe and the undead horrors festering the desert sands were but petty squabbles, trifles that buzzed like flies upon the desert’s cruel winds in the eyes of this eldritch being. A week wore on, each day an agonising journey through a city steeped in the macabre. They encountered broken souls, remnants of once-vivid aspirations. Amongst these wretched inhabitants, they met Eleni, a dust elf trader whose wares outweighed her capacity to sell. A paradox of prosperity turned to burden, she offered potions and arcane stones, their very existence a lifeline in this desolate place. Then there was Marcus, a senior knight fervent in his belief in the primacy of Faletism. He whispered of a plot to wrest control of the FFKA East from the grasp of Sergarus, a design that, though bloodless, bore ominous risks. The tidings brought forth a revelation—the FFKA believed the heart of the undead menace lay hidden in Glasrath. Finally, amidst the maddening symphonies of a Mercian house, their senses were assaulted by music and perverse indulgences. There, in the throes of fleshly excess, revelations spilled forth like tainted wine. A revelation carved with Imortra’s name—a name that resonated as the architect of a new Mercian cult that had entrapped them in the inescapable web of Linhe’s shadows. None of these plans and dreams would endure, dashed like fragile glass beneath the relentless march of thousands rotting feet, with no heroes remaining to shield them, as the Glasrath champions went back to Holzander, the supposed root of the evil. 5.15 Chapter 17 &amp; 18 Mothers In the first night of their travel, the Glasrath champions encounter another infected Lady Scurvy. They are powerful now and quickly kill the creature. After some investigation, they learn that the infection is of an alien origin, where one parasite creature is attached to the neck of a rather normal ghoul. This specific creature, seemed controlled by some kind of desire to consume others, but entertained the construction of some kind of altar until the broken heroes found it and destroyed it. The altar contained a stone with the names of Kimbarak and Ethux’zhurh, related to some kind of ancient dark ritual. The following days of travel were less dangerous, although some dark visions occured to each of the champions. guilf was the first one, and had a melancholic vision of the world being uncreated by the current powers in play. Next Dolman, after a confusing dream, came to realise that different than all the other undead they have battled for so long, these new “reality flickering” creatures had no smell. Finally, amyria suddely succumbs to some call from the desert and, on her knees and hands in the sand, feels the weight of so many layers of civilisation after civilisation whose ruins scatter the desert in unmemorable depths - and all those that died when civilisations collapse, now their bodies ready to be reanimated for some dark cause. The peril is immense. The party finds their way into the Holzander castle for one more time, and learn from Cagoth-ze that there is some intense power struggle for leadership amongst the Deepfolk, after Bjrnyar was killed. Guilf decides to investigate the Deepfolk level from the collapsed floor of the library, and sees a body on the top of the rubble pile. In a smart and stealth move, he ties the body and rescue it to the floor above, before the Deepfolk realise their bait has been removed. The body is dolman’s mother - Gaelira. She is not dead, but instead in some coma state. Reading her mind, Guilf finds buried a cognitive distress call: “The world is going to end. The Brezal paths have to be disentangled from the castle’s artefacts to release the tension. The Arcane Furnace, The Crystal Platform and the Sphere of Annihilation must be destroyed.” With this goal clear in their head, the broken heroes go to Danaska first, as the master of oozes have been using the Alchemist Furnace for years now. Amyria, in a high morale decision, intimidates Danaska to step away, and the ooze scholar decides to leave the castle. After failing their first attempt to disable the furnace, the heroes decide to climb down to the Deepfolk level, and stealthily take them down. They almost succeed, but before the first foes can be killed in silent, one of them whistles, signalling intrudes to the others. The party is quickly surrounded and, once Dolman falls unconscious shot down by a dozen arrows, the group’s morale is shaken and they give in. The Deepfolk takes their armours and weapons and call in the Derro, from the level below, to take the group to Imortra. After climbing down through a hole they are received by Derril and, in that minute, Brilhorte who was in the block form inside the sack with all the weapons and armours, turns back into his humanoid form. Surprised, Derril makes a lame attack with a club, which is easily parried by Brilhorte, who then decapitates the Derro. For about half an hour, the group discussed what to do, and tried a few options. In the end, they decide to peacefully approach the other Derro, who did not seem to intend harm. Brilhorte goes back to his block form. As the broken heroes meet Gilsfeyr, priest of the Derro bat-cult, they learn of a plan to take down Imortra. The Derro have been her though-prisoners for decades, and want freedom. The plan includes a partnership with Kuku, the leader of the Derro village who share this caverns with the bat-cult. After agreeing with Gilsfeyr and Kuku, the party takes some mushroom tea, which supposedly gives them true sight on reality, as the Derro explain this will be required. And then walk towards Imortra and her supporters. Imortra is expecting the three heroes. Amyria and Guilf try in vain to convince Imortra that her means are evil, and that others are suffering. Imortra’s sweet arguments seem strong, and she explains that all of them are of utmost importance for summoning The Void. Amyria will act as a conduit for Thalia’s power, that will channel to Dolman, who holds the spirt of Kimbarak, and is able to stop the Legacy powers that protect reality against the violence that the summoning ritual represents. Finally, Guilf will be the lighthouse for The Void, so that the powerful god can reach his destination. The heroes decide to pretend to follow Imortra’s plan, with the concealed motivation to use the opportunity to destroy the sphere of annihilation and save the Angel Hound without summoning The Void. Although Guilf is still inclined to continue with the ritual. The deal is settled when Imortra orders Gailiera to be brought down, and one of the Ngar’tho attends to her mental wounds, and the group prepares to enter what Imortra described as land of Nightmares. 5.16 Chapter 19 The Nightmare River The broken heroes debated a plan: go deeper in the holzanderCastle, find Gellert and kill him. After that they will think on how to destroy the artefacts in the castle. With true sight teas in a canteen, they venture into the abyss of a nightmare. In the dark cave below, they see a river and a boatman. The boatman requires payment to take them in other locations in the river, and they promptly ask to be taken to Gellert. The boats starts navigating but finds a rocky area. Dolman, Amyria and Guilf have to cross the rocks on foot. Joyfully trying to copy Dolman’s athletics aptitude in the jumps, Guilf falls into the river, awakening dark souls around them. After fighting a lady_scurvy and evourecs’ attempts to grapple and connect to the broken heroes intellects, the group safely resumes the navigation on the river, with the boatman that now waiting them after the rocks. From the river, a nightmarish humanoid-experiment (Wilbur Whateley) starts talking with the group, explaining that all the rooms in the river are laboratories used by the Ngar’tho. He also tells the sad story of his wife, who has been deconstructed and made into the walls of one of the rooms. The group finally arrives in a stone landing, with a small construction attached in one of the cavern walls and a staircase on the other side. Dolman and Guilf climb up the stairs, and find themselves on different places, so they retract. Looking through the construction’s door keyhole, Guilf sees a shadow servant organising the “house”. After asking the boatman again to be taken to Gellert, the vessel starts navigating in the opposite direction, and the group find themselves repeating what they had just experienced backwards. They continue until another landing, where Dolman asks the boatman to stop. After some careful investigation, the heroes learn they just avoided a trap, where Deep Ones were planning to arrow them to death in a corner of the river. In a strategic move, the party holds the door shut, while a nightmare darkness is cast within the room with the Deep Ones. Only one ventures outside, barely alive, and is then put to death. Through another door, the group hears a ritual chanting, and through an inquiry with the dead Deep One they learn The Void is within the walls of that room, hurt. Focused on finding Gellert, another journey demand is made to the boatman, which conducts the boat for the third time through the same place. The heroes don’t exactly know anymore which way is which. The broken heroes continued their journey through the nightmare. Amyria decided to explore the caverns with her spiritual eye and found they are locked in a loop of dual realities, with rooms cycling back to other rooms. They find Gellert and a long friendly conversation happens. Gellert shares about the accident that created a sphere of annihilation, and how the Angel Hound was lost to it. Gellert also proposes riches to Amyria, Dolman and Guilf if they were to destroy the sphere. The group debates a plan again, and after what seems to have been months locked in the nightmare, they decide to go downstairs. As part of the nightmares, the group helps Wilbur Whateley’s desire to finish the life of his wife (Mary) and his own. While the heroes execute it, a ngar-tho observes. Upon encountering the sphere, the group is prepared to face it, and after a short but dangerous exchange, they manage to break up the sphere. The Angel Hound was locked inside, but now not just what it was - it seems to be part of the Ngar’tho shared intellect. 5.17 Chapter 20 Waking Up After resting for what felt like years, Amyria, Guilf and Dolman decide to leave Gellert’s dwelling with a plan to rescue Gaelira. They are older and look dirtier and meaner. Guilf is now an adult. They seem more and more under the control of their ancestral spirits: Kimbarak, The Void and Thalia - and that scared the group. Before they leave, Gellert pays his part of the agreement and hands over three powerful rings: Ring of Earth, Ring of Sun and Ring of Command. The three heroes go upstairs and explain to the ngar-tho that a part of the ritual requires them to take Gaelira out of the castle. The Ngar’tho seems uncertain, and shares that coming back to the castle might be difficult once they leave. The group is not deterred, and they climb up to the third level, where the Imortra’s Deepfolk reside. On that level, a very short exchange of words teaches the Deepfolk that this group is not to be messed with, and the soldiers back off. The original path they descended to this level of the castle, when they first came in, is now blocked, but they quickly learn from the Deepfolk that the stables tunnel can also be used to leave directly to the desert. Once in the tunnel, Amyria is the first one to use her ring, and conjured a sun’s light from her eyes to observer the world beyond sand and stone. She sees a camp a mile from their current location, and the group decides to travel there. The camp is a strange one. A mix of dust elves, dwarves and humans are gathered together to do what they call “Laying Low”. The heroes meet the camp leader Clotilde, a bearded dwarf woman, and their minds start to shatter when they realise 25 years have passed. The people from the camp are laying low to hide themselves from the several battles happening in the desert, in a war that has started now a decade ago. On the next morning the heroes are determined to find the castle again, the original entrance through Mystra’s door. Still carrying Gaelira unconscious, they see risks in going through the first level, now taken by hundreds of undead. Dolman decides to use his own ring now, and very quickly finds passage through earth and stone for the group. As they navigate the earth, they find other passages in the castle they never knew about. Once they reach Cagoth-Ze the gnome is astonished to meet them again, thinking they perished decades ago. After a friendly conversation, the group convinces Cagoth to summon a Ngar’tho again, this time with Gaelira within the summoning circle. Cagoth is afraid of the plan, but is convinced. The Ngar’tho is summoned, but things do not go as planned. The creature has no desire to be quickly released, and time pressure would not convince it to wake Gaelira up. The next plan involves leaving Cagoth with the Ngar’tho for a few hours, while Amyria, Guilf and Dolman navigate through earth again and ambush Gellert. The fight begins with Dolman and Guilf falling crying over their own madness, but the group quickly recovers and Gellert is destroyed. The entire exchange lasted no more than 20 seconds. They didn’t talk. The group comes back to Cagoth (7 years later), only to find that the summoning circle failed for a millisecond, enough time for Cagoth to be slay by the Ngar’tho. The corpse is left in the floor, with a face of agony. He suffered. After the sad events, the group decides to use Cagoth’s machine, which continue to work, to visit the Elven Library once more. They learn that only another powerful creature, such as an old dragon, would be able to circumvent the Ngar’tho’s mind control over Gaelira. They also learn that the creatures known as Angels (also called Acrisae in other languages) have been in war with humankind for millennia. Armed with this knowledge, and a lot of emotional baggage, the group prepares to leave to Mystra’s Temple. The temple might be a drop of hope in the current sea of misery.

But this time the robot is different - stronger, larger and darker. A few minutes later a swarm of Evourec’s attack the Glasrath Champions. The fight is easy, unlike comprehending how and why these creatures of water are moving around in the desert. On the next day the group walks fast, and reach the broken statue of The Void again. This time Guilf shows little excitement with it. Just before dawn, Amyria pretends to guard while reading the book of knowledge. A sneaky elf, Filarion, gets close and calls Amyria. The group is told that Filarions and the remainder of their friends are living in a crevasse nearby, and had picked up a fight with the wrong foe. What appeared to be a dirty hermit turned out to be a powerful angel, and the group is now being hunted by it for trying to steal its sword. The Glasrath Champions were not excited with the proposition and instead, convinced 3 out of the 5 friends to continue travelling with them, instead of living in the crevasse. Amyria ends up being cursed by one that is staying behind - but that did not last long. The champions and their 3 new travel companions now travel underground, in the maze of ruins and tunnels beneath the desert. Thirteen, the scout of Filarion’s group is a skilful traveller through the tunnels. As Amyria continues to read the book of knowledge, she gets seduced by it, and start to loose herself in it. In one of the evenings she seems to have waken up a nightmare, which turned out to be powerful and attacked the group. In a hard fight, one of the new companions died of fear, while the other one run away. Amyria cast a godlike figure protecting Thirteen and Galiera from the nightmare. Thirteen holdfast and stayed, proving his new acquired loyalty to the Champions, and a devotion to Guilf. The group regathers their strength and continue for a few more days, when they meet Mustroc Heavymace - one of the survivors of the Battle for Ammuinoth. Mustroc explains that Ghuse has, over the last decades, set an industrious economy of mining and weapon building, that supplies both sides of the ongoing war.
