<h3>Context<a href="hostile.html#context" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Hostile</strong> is a tabletop RPG set in a universe that combines elements of gritty science fiction, horror, and political intrigue. It is heavily inspired by the aesthetics and themes of classic 1970s and 1980s sci-fi movies such as “Alien,” “Blade Runner,” and “Outland.” The game is designed to evoke a sense of being on the edge of known space, where human life is cheap, corporate interests dominate, and the unknown looms at every corner.</p>
<p>Space is a hostile environment, not just because of its physical dangers but also due to the socio-political landscape. The game emphasises themes of corporate greed, the expendability of human life in the pursuit of profit, and the struggle of the working class against oppressive systems. Political intrigue plays a significant role, with factions within and between corporations, as well as other groups with their agendas, vying for power and influence.</p>
<div id="themes" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Themes<a href="hostile.html#themes" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gritty sci-fi</strong>: Characters are blue collar spacers, working dangerous jobs in the hostility of space. Every hazard is trying to kill characters all the time. Everything in the world that isn’t an active corporate interest is run down, decaying, and stained. Earth is a traditional cyberpunk setting, but in space there is much less “street violence”, and cybernetics are generally not reliable. <em>List of hazards: lack of oxygen, vacuum, radiation, excessive cold, excessive heat, aliens, alien infections, poisonous atmosphere, high pressure atmosphere, high decompression rate and high gravity acceleration in large bodies.</em></li>
<li><strong>Horror &amp; fear</strong>: A cynical world, filled with everyday people going about their jobs is a common starting point for good horror stories. Humans are not alone in the universe. Alien predators have been found in multiple worlds, and sometimes even in asteroids. Advanced alien societies had their remnants found by earth explorers, but intelligent life is still to be observed. Some theorists say they have been found, and are among us. And none knows when and where aliens will be found.</li>
<li><strong>Political intrigue &amp; treachery</strong>: Several factions with their own motives and goals. Everyone is out for their own interests, and they’re trustworthy only so long as their interests align with yours. Everyone assumes that deals will be kept only so long as they’re mutually profitable and relationships will only continue as long as they offer benefits to all parties. Factions are classified in 3 groups:
<ul>
<li><strong>Technology &amp; resourceful factions</strong>: the strongest group, mostly formed by Mega Corporations and their subsidiaries.</li>
<li><strong>Belief factions</strong>: their Influence is subtle and ideological, mostly formed by religions and conspiracy theorists</li>
<li><strong>Rising authoritative supra-government</strong>: early years of an attempt of Earth governments to regain control from the Mega Corporations hands - the Terran Mandate.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<div id="aesthetic" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Aesthetic<a href="hostile.html#aesthetic" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>The aesthetic of <strong>Hostile</strong> is defined by its gritty, realistic approach to science fiction. Technology is not clean and advanced but rather functional, often run-down, and always with a practical purpose. Cybernetics are unreliable, and life in space is hazardous, with threats such as lack of oxygen, radiation, and alien infections being commonplace. The setting is designed to feel lived-in, with every location showing signs of wear and decay, reflecting the hard life of those who dwell in space.</p>

<p><strong>Stars Without Number</strong> is a sandbox-style science fiction tabletop RPG that embraces an “old-school renaissance” gaming philosophy, drawing mechanical inspiration from classic RPGs of the 1970s. It’s designed to support a wide range of sci-fi adventures, from gritty mercenary actions to space opera, allowing players and game masters significant freedom to shape the game to their interests. Different than old school D&amp;D, SWN has a much simpler class system, with most of the customisation done through background, foci (i.e. feats) and a robust skill system (based on classic Traveler - which is the skill system of the Hostile game too). Additional flavour from other games are always welcomed (OSR compatible preferred, but anything can be discussed): Any rule, class, foci, etc from any OSR game can be considered. <a href="https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/publisher/3482/Sine-Nomine-Publishing">Sine Nomine</a> books are very easy to integrate with each other. I have a few of them if someone is interested.</p>

<p>PC’s individual (short term) stress is abstracted to a game pace mechanics: <strong>Tension Pool</strong>. The <strong>Tension Pool</strong> is managed by the GM.</p>
<p><strong>Long term (affliction)</strong></p>
<p>Long term mental decay (i.e. <strong>Afflictions</strong>) happens when it is narratively coherent. Long term mental decay is not a major theme of Hostile, so it will be used sparingly. The GM will ask for a Mental Save when there is a chance to develop an <strong>Affliction</strong> and they will be randomly rolled on the following <strong>MMR</strong> table.</p>

<h2>Prelude<a href="hostile.html#prelude" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Advanced alien ruins were found in 2223 in the Perdurabo system. An ice sample was bought by Tharsis’ Parkfield Biolabs, which contained RNA that can be used to cure early dementia caused by frequent faster than light travel. The RNA named Neuroplasticity Augmentor Sequence (NAS-RNA), however, the RNA cannot be easily replicated in laboratory. For this reason, the discovery was not made public yet, and Tharsis has been moving fast to evaluate the feasibility to establish an ice mine in the system.</p>
<p>If proven feasible, the existence of the Brightside Mining Station in the system is an advantage. The station is a poorly managed facility that would be easy to purchase if the exploration proves commerciality of the play (see Hostile-Setting 82, for detail on the licensing process).</p>
<p>Perdurabo is a system blazing with the murderous light of a red giant star. The hard-bitten miners of the Brightside Mining Station maintain the only outpost of civilisation in a system filled with lethal light and stellar outlaws. Ancient asteroid sky tombs lie in the vicinity while a seething rebellion boils beneath Brightside Station’s steel skin.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Doomborgs crew arrives in Brightside. Brightside is a space mining station owned by <a href="https://i.imgur.com/xla77J1.png">Haruna</a>, part of the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/VY7zssZ.png">Matsuyama</a> group.</li>
<li>The crew meets a few of the faces on the station and take a space raft to their own ship, which is stationary close by Brightside.</li>
<li>After a quick inspection, the Frostbreaker seems in order, and the crew get back to Brightside to sign paperwork.</li>
<li>While mingling a bit more with the inhabitants of the station, they end up befriending Marius, a scientific representative from <a href="https://i.imgur.com/bVblDuU.png">Makita</a> (part of the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/QEu2vfo.png">Wu-Ketai</a> group). He is invited for a mission launch party onboard the Frostbreaker and, on the way there, the crew also invites Roland.</li>
<li>Everyone gets drunk and drugged and some information is learned: Marius thinks his job is demeaning while Roland has data that incriminates Yash (Brightside Director) of embezzlement.</li>
<li>In the following morning the crew have a virtual meeting with John McLeod, who is unhappy that some information might have leaked about the intention to drill ice in the asteroid. Olaf takes a decision to visit one of the sky tombs in the region, to pretend the crew is one of adventurers and dismiss questions.</li>
<li>The crew goes back and negotiate with Marius and Ranse, and they purchase the coordinates of one of the sky tombs that could possess some riches.</li>

<p><strong>MadSpark’s version of the story</strong>
&gt; <strong><em>MadSpark doesn’t remember much of this, his version of events goes as follows</em></strong>
&gt; - arrived at a space station after a boring travel but made a neat little BB Gun from my seatbelt
&gt; - got told to put my shotgun in a locker (but luckily kept my hunting knife)
&gt; - found some great spare parts for the little drone I’ve been planning to make
&gt; - the ship has a basic but adequately equipped workshop, so started work on the drone
&gt; - everyone wanted to explore the space station &amp; I needed a drink anyway so off we went
&gt; - then there were some of these guys who had a bug in their asses about something to do with stealing (apparently it’s not allowed here… 🤷🏼‍♂️) but the skipper sorted it out &amp; then we headed to the bar (it’s interesting that the cameras here are ATX18956 model - I haven’t seen those of years, I’ll have to take one apart at some point for nostalgic reasons)
&gt; - I bought drinks all night &amp; did that trick with the exploding gunpowder shots - I don’t remember much after that
&gt; - Oh yeah, we’re going to see if we can find some valuable alien artefacts to make some extra moolah 💰(sounds more interesting than the mission anyway!)</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> The Cold Tomb<a href="hostile.html#the-cold-tomb" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The Doomborgs crew arrive in the Cold Tomb. The structure was built in an ice chunk in one of the asteroids in the Perdurabo system.</li>
<li>The ship is docked in the entrance of the tomb, and Olaf and Oliver suit up and are ready in the air lock. Through a scan they know that beyond the tomb entrance door the environment is filled with icy water.</li>
<li>The two crewmen venture inside, with a system of communication and power umbilicals and a 50 meter harness cable. Sabaka stays behind in the airlock ready to rewind the cable if necessary.</li>
<li>In the entrance room, shaped like a sphere, they record on their cameras alien language carved in the icy wall, and an image depicting a blurred humanoid alien in what seems like a position of power.</li>
<li>While this was happening, MadSpark feels the need of action, and leaves the ship in a second airlock. While investigating the surroundings of the construction, he detects faint biological matter readings on his suit. He communicates that to Olaf and Oliver, who now turn on their precise detectors too, receiving the same readings.</li>
<li>The crew hypothesise that the readings are coming from the water (melted from the asteroid ice), and take a sample from inside the tomb. MadSpark gets back on the ship and take the sample to the lab. He starts to feel dizzy.</li>
<li>In the tomb, Oliver and Olaf reach another room where they find dozens of alien bodies floating in the water. They quickly grab one and, in a haste movement, decide to retreat to the spaceship.</li>
<li>On their way back, a drone swims in their direction and shoots a shard of metal in their direction, but the crewmen were faster and lock themselves in the airlock before the drone can enter. Oni skillfully undock the Frostbreaker from the tomb and pilot the ship back to Brightside.</li>
<li>After decontaminating the air, Olaf and Oliver join the crew in the ship again, but now everyone is feeling slightly sick, unfocused and dizzy.</li>
<li>On the way back, some movement readings withing the starship structure alert Oni. The crew quickly retreat to the citadel and command the ship from there. They soon see in the cameras a dozens crab-like alien creatures exploring she starship.</li>
<li>MadSpark flushes the starship atmosphere. At the same time Olaf starts to feel very sick and anxious. He thinks for a brief moment that MadSpark is flushing the citadel and panics. The other crew members calm him down, and they all see the crab creatures passing out.</li>
<li>Upon arrival in Brightside, Yash Dutta does not allow the immediate off boarding of the crew due to contamination risk, and Olaf decides to speak with John McLeod. John quickly decides that the finding is too high profile, and the Doomborgs are ordered to immediatelly travel back to Earth.</li>
<li>After a failed attempt to threat Yash, the Frostbreaker departs from Brightside. The destination is the Teegarden’s Star system, where in the main world (Defiance) a remote office of Tharsis and the ICO (Interstellar Commerce Organisation) are available.</li>

<ul>
<li>The Doomborgs crew travel to the neighbour system: the Teegarden’s Star. During the spike drill, Bennet used the time to execute a biopsy on one of the crab creatures that infested the starship previously. The doctor was very unlucky when a splash of acid hits his eyes, blinding him.</li>
<li>Upon arriving on Teegarden’s Star, the captain makes contact with the system control and gets redirected to the Tharsis Mining office on the <a href="https://sectorswithoutnumber.com/sector/E9FKrPjS8tsRmoryYMpe/planet/UBzrpfVGWXxJZq6C9ndC">Defiance</a>. A shuttle picks the crew from orbit and a truck and a car takes them and the corpse to the corporation estate.</li>
<li>The Doomborgs meet Lucas, a rough operations coordinator in the system, who explains next steps: they are to complete the mining contract as fast as possible, avoiding any further information leak. The Boxer crew, a group of mercenaries, will be responsible for collecting the remaining corpses and taking them to Earth.</li>
<li>While the meeting goes on, Bennet is in the hospital, and learns his eyes are doomed. He will need a cybernetic implant, and that can be arranged within a week.</li>
<li>The crew meets again, and decide that waiting a week would be too long. Sabaka connects on the dark web and finds a fixer that can help them get a second hand cybereyes set within a day. The Doomborgs agree with the fixer and go to the appointed location, a district nightclub.</li>
<li>In the nightclub they meet an energetic girl, who are to guide them getting the second hand cybereyes - from someone wearing it! They get into a VIP booth, where the target is having fun with what looks like a prostitute. The crew is swift and put the target on the floor, while the girl they just met “pops off” his eyes.</li>
<li>The group successfully drive to a shady cybernetic clinic where Bennet has his new eyes implanted. They are ready to continue their mining contract now, and travel back to Perdurabo.</li>
<li>In the Cold Tomb, they find the Leadbelly docked to the tomb, while The Boxer’s ship - the Brutomaker - is docked to the second airlock of the Leadbelly. Oni docks the Frostbreaker to the Brutomaker.</li>
<li>MadSpark starts the first drone, but an issue with setting the explosives on the ice chunk means that drone is lost in space.</li>
<li>Olaf speaks with The Boxer over comms, and they agree to meet and trade a drone from the Brutomaker.</li>
<li>The Doomborg meets The Boxer and his crew, while they loot the Cold Tomb and move the valuables to the Brutomaker. The crew of the Leadbelly is tied up and gagged, and left in the Leadbelly for the Doomborgs to figure out.</li>
<li>Then, suddenly, while being playful with the new drone, MadSpark cause an accident and an oxygen leak in the Brutomaker. The two crews start running, but most of The Boxer’s crew was further in the aft of the starship, and are lost to space with everything in that part of the ship when it explodes.</li>
<li>Bennet and MadSpark are safe in the Frostbreaker, while Oni, Olaf and Sabaka - together with TheBoxer and his engineer and the hostages - are safe in the Leadbelly.</li>

<li>Considering his remaining options, <a href="../npcs/TheBoxer.md">TheBoxer</a> sees an opportunity to forge his own death and finally retire in a small farm in Defiance.</li>
<li>This setup is agreed with everyone, but it requires erasing the proofs of Boxer being alive - which includes killing the hostages from the Leadbelly.</li>
<li>The Boxer and Oliver coldly push <a href="../npcs/RanseHardlee.md">RanseHardlee</a>, <a href="../npcs/RandallBellows.md">RandallBellows</a>, <a href="../npcs/JaffaOkoye.md">JaffaOkoye</a> from the airlock.</li>

<li><a href="../pcs/Oni.md">Oni</a> skilfully uninstall the lead panels from the<a href="../objects/Frostbreaker.md">Frostbreaker</a>, so they can land the ship in <a href="../locations/Defiance.md">Defiance</a> to drop the Boxer.</li>

<ul>
<li>The Doomborgs took their time and evaluated all the options to unload <a href="../npcs/TheBoxer.md">TheBoxer</a> into Defiance.</li>
<li>They decide that putting The Boxer in a large box is the best alternative.</li>
<li>They called flight control from <a href="../locations/Defiance.md">Defiance</a> and requested to speak with <a href="../factions/tharsisMining.md">tharsisMining</a>.</li>
<li>Lucas called back and agreed to find a maintenance bay for the <a href="../objects/Frostbreaker.md">Frostbreaker</a> in two days.</li>

<li>Lucas spoke again with the crew, and was astonished to know that <a href="../npcs/JohnMcLeod.md">JohnMcLeod</a> speaks with the crew through an AI version of himself - this is not allowed on Earth.</li>
<li>Lucas also updates the crew that information leaked about the alien bodies, and the possible extraction of the mRNA - which is expensive in the market.</li>
<li><a href="../pcs/Olaf.md">Olaf</a> becomes anxious, and postpone the next chat with <a href="../npcs/JohnMcLeod.md">JohnMcLeod</a></li>
<li><a href="../pcs/Danny.md">Danny</a> and <a href="../pcs/Oliver.md">Oliver</a> go to a local lowlife bar and meet the owner of a small and shady logistics company, Harry.</li>

<li>The crew meet again at the bay, prepare everything and load the box with The Boxer into Harry’s company truckers’ truck.</li>
<li>The crew speaks with <a href="../npcs/JohnMcLeod.md">JohnMcLeod</a> who confirms what Lucas has shared. John mentions that there is an inevitable gold rush about to start for Perdurabo. The crew is to be back there ASAP, and start mining as much as possible. A new contract will be sent to them.</li>
<li>After the long day, Oliver goes take a nap, while the others decide to continue drinking into the small hours.</li>
<li>In the same low life bar the crew meet a (very drunk) <a href="../npcs/CassianVireo.md">CassianVireo</a></li>
<li>Cassian mentions she is an investigator, and she wants to get information on what is happening in <a href="../locations/BrightsideStation.md">BrightsideStation</a> and the Perdurabo system. Cassian offers her skills in computing and communications in return to be brought to Brightside. The crew is undecided and were to speak with her again next day, before departing Defiance.</li>

<ul>
<li>The Doomborgs receive a <strong>new contract</strong> that voids the exploration framework of the previous contract, but maintain taking down the directorship of <a href="../locations/BrightsideStation.md">BrightsideStation</a>
<ul>
<li>The crew will be paid C5k for each Hull cargo space full of unrefined mRNA-rich ice. This value is doubled if the ice is refined.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Doomborgs try to find a mobile extractor micro refinery to install on their ship, but that was too difficult in a planet like <a href="../locations/Defiance.md">Defiance</a>. Oni sends a message to her friend in <a href="../locations/TheSolomons.md">TheSolomons</a> and asks her to buy one and bring it to Brightside. The message ends with ‘<em>Don’t rip me off</em>’.</li>
<li>While trying to find an extractor, Danny inadvertently tells Harry Tungla that there was someone inside the box his trucker carried to the farm.</li>
<li>The crew then decides to take <a href="../npcs/CassianVireo.md">CassianVireo</a> with them to Brightside, for what she pays C2k.</li>
<li>Flying off defiance is delayed in 4 days, due to weather. But even when the weather improves the <a href="../objects/Frostbreaker.md">Frostbreaker</a> barely does it, with its fusion reactor shutting down due to load as the ship gains orbit.</li>
<li>They dock the ship in a refuelling station in high orbit and get a new drone, and from there depart to Perdurabo</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8iAc2zM.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Upon arriving in Brightside, the Doomborgs learn that Dutta has fallen ill, and <a href="../npcs/RolandLomax.md">RolandLomax</a> is now in charge. It became useful that the crew had a night drinking with Lomax when they first arrived in Perdurabo.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0PTNdEm.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Lomax asks them to offboard the Frostbreaker and explains that in about 6 days a large <a href="../factions/haruna.md">haruna</a> bank transport will arrive to carry the Novium ingots. A bank auditor will be on this ship, and Lomax intends to share the information he has about Dutta’s embezzlement.</li>
<li>Lomax asks the Doomborgs to be around when this happens, to show strength against <a href="../npcs/YashDutta.md">YashDutta</a>’s faction on the station.</li>
<li>Lomax also mentions that another <a href="../factions/tharsisMining.md">tharsisMining</a> ship (the Ore Voyager) recently refuelled in Brigthside, and the crew updates him that they also work for Tharsis. ‘<em>Why is Tharsis Mining involved in finding alien artefacts?</em>’.</li>

<ul>
<li>The crew goes back to the <a href="../locations/ColdTomb.md">ColdTomb</a> to mine the mRNA-rich ice around the construction (that is now destroyed).</li>
<li>Mining was a dangerous endeavour, where one drone and many ice cargoes were lost.</li>
<li>Incidentally, the crab infestation in the ship attacks Danny while he is piloting, in one of the most critical moments: Olaf and Oni are on an EVA, while Bennet is monitoring the harness. Danny is alone in the bridge and tries to fight off the crabs. He was unsuccessful and falls with a mortal face wound when one of the crabs lands on his face.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/U3rM5gA.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>The other crew members rush back when they notice Danny screaming, and Olaf in a heroic save fends off multiple crabs while grappling an unconscious Danny.</li>
<li>The Doomborgs are able to seal the crabs in the bridge and Bennet with his laser sharp medic skills is able to stabilise Danny - who looked dead already.</li>
<li>After this accident, the crew decides to go back to Brightside with a partial load. They would come back later with someone skilled in piloting the drones.</li>
<li>Upon arrival on Brightside, Danny is rushed into the infirmary. Olaf speaks with the doctor, <a href="../npcs/SuyinIndrani.md">SuyinIndrani</a>, who supports Dutta and thinks Lomax has poisoned the director. She also shares that Lomax is not liked by his own employees.</li>
<li>The personnel on the station start to go about quickly now, as the bank’s transport is arriving. Lomax is ready to share what he knows.</li>

<p><strong>Arrival of Sabaka</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The banker transport arrives and, while they wait and prepare to disembark, a burnt escape pod also arrives in the station.</li>
<li>Inside the pod is <a href="../pcs/Sabaka.md">Sabaka</a>, unconscious. There is also a significant amount of transparent and reflective goo.</li>
<li>A technician takes the goo to the station laboratory for study.</li>
<li>Sakaba is taken to the infirmary, where they are evaluated. <a href="../pcs/Oliver.md">Oliver</a> Bennet helps Dr <a href="../npcs/SuyinIndrani.md">SuyinIndrani</a> and finds a metallic object inside Sabaka’s anus. Sabaka wakes up as the object is being removed.</li>
<li><a href="../pcs/Olaf.md">Olaf</a> and <a href="../pcs/Oni.md">Oni</a> go to the <a href="../objects/Frostbreaker.md">Frostbreaker</a> to study the egg like metallic object.</li>
<li>Bennet stays in the infirmary with Sabaka and <a href="../pcs/Danny.md">Danny</a>, who were recovering from the <a href="../statblocks/PopperSwarm.md">PopperSwarm</a> attack.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7c4MxZ1.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Research the metallic egg and the alien language filmed.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Oni and Olaf are in the Frostbreaker, and start researching the alien bas relief from the cold tomb, recorded on film month ago.</li>
<li><strong>Metallic egg</strong>
<ul>
<li>Oni researches the egg. It is made of some unknown metal, with hardness 6.5 (slightly harder than a steel alloy)</li>
<li>The egg does not crush when hit repeatedly with a hammer, but no further destructive tests were conducted.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCdfOrE.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Film</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bas relief is ritualistic in nature</li>
<li>On the right side, multiple species are shown to be linked somehow. This can be an evolutionary link, a carrier link, some kind of multi symbiosis or maybe some hive mind. They do remind Earth animals somehow.</li>
<li>On the left side, a technological insect humanoid species seems to control the other civilisation. They are clearly aliens to the beings on the right side.</li>
<li>It seems that the approach taken by the insectoids is to swarm a civilisation and conquer. They are shown with weapons.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8Q6BYmV.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>As they look at the video, Olaf becomes very interested in the insectoid aliens and his mind is suddenly taken by the memories and emotions of his abduction decades ago. His mind rebuilds a perfect image of these aliens as Olaf starts to become anxious.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8D39rQN.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Half a second later a flash of light is seen from one of the windows of the Frosbreaker, Olaf curls himself in the floor, repeating some kind of mantra. Oni looks at the windows and sees that some kind of explosion has happened on the high deck of Brigthside.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bombs in Brightside</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For those in Brigthside, a tremor is felt, and the alarm goes off first, then lights turn off, while emergency lights turn on.</li>
<li>Bennet and Danny come down from the infirmary carrying Sabaka, to meet Olaf and Oni again on the cargo bay.</li>
<li>The banker transport is preparing to depart, to avoid any kind of terrorist act that seems to be taking place in the station. As the belly of the ship is exposed, Olaf and Oni immediately notice some kind of explosive attached to the ship.</li>
<li>Olaf rapidly informs this on open channel to the banker transport and 20 seconds later a escape pod leaves the ship. A second escape pod leaves a minute later. The transport does not explode, yet.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Investigate Dutta’s documents</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Olaf speaks with <a href="../npcs/RolandLomax.md">RolandLomax</a> and take the documentations that would expose Dutta from Roland’s hands. Roland is ok with it, feeling it is the best route of action.</li>
<li>Oni quickly parse these documents and finds:
<ul>
<li>Embezzlement of <a href="../npcs/YashDutta.md">YashDutta</a>, who stole money during the construction of Brightside, alonside the son of one of the private minor investors.</li>
<li>Purchase orders from <strong>Recombination Group</strong> (<a href="https://i.imgur.com/1ouPtfu.png">logo</a>) for shipment of Novium - which might explain the fact the the station was not meeting Haruna’s production quotas.</li>
<li>MoU with <a href="../factions/makita.md">makita</a>’s subsidiary for ice mining rights - although the two companies are competitors and such an extraction agreement would not be allowed in the new space law from the <a href="../factions/ico.md">ico</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xE2V8yO.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Repairs on the fusion reactor</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Oni and Bennet go to the high deck to help repair the fusion reactor. The core is not damaged, but most auxiliary systems are destroyed. It will take weeks, if not months, for a complete fix. A crew of technicians start the work.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Haruna Banker</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../npcs/ElianaMurovec.md">ElianaMurovec</a> and her bodyguard leave the transport</li>
<li>Olaf softly tells her of the documents the crew has in their possession.</li>
<li>Eliana agrees to a private conversation inside her pod where Olaf shares what he knows, and the documentation that proves it.</li>
<li>Eliana is flabbergast, and after thinking of her options, she offers to pay Olaf to take her back to <a href="../locations/TheSolomons.md">TheSolomons</a>.</li>
<li>Olaf explains he needs to discuss it with his crew first, and leaves the pod.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/q6m1Pir.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Conversation with <a href="../npcs/CassianVireo.md">CassianVireo</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bennet finds Cassian again, in the midst of turmoil in the station.</li>
<li>Cassian explain she has been working in the Midnight Sun bar, and wishes to go back and leave Brightside, as she is afraid of what is happening.</li>
<li>Bennet promises to contact her again before they depart.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Decisions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The crew meets again in the cargo bay, and decide they will take the banker.</li>
<li>Before they leave, Bennet, Danny and Sabaka go to the Midnight Sun bar and speak with <a href="../npcs/MarionHardlee.md">MarionHardlee</a>. Marion confirms Cassian was never an employee on the bar. The crew decides to leave her behind, and it would be too risky to confront her now.</li>
<li>Bennet decides to inform the risk of Cassian to Roland, who becomes very unpleased. Roland demands that the Frosbreaker crew take Cassian back, if there is a risk she is the bomber. It was the Frostbreaker who brought Cassian to the station in the first place.</li>
<li>The conversation does not go well, and it turns to violence. Bennet quickly stab Roland twice before Roland decides to give up this fight. Roland covers his wound, and decide to go to the infirmary.</li>
<li>The crew discusses and decide it is best to leave Roland alive.</li>
<li>They board Eliana in the Frostbreaker and depart the station.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Leaving Perdurabo, and…</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Frostbreaker scoops hydrogen fuel from the penumbra of The Beast and are ready to go.</li>
<li>Around two days later, close to the edge of the Perdurabo system, something hard and heavy hits the Frostbreaker.</li>
<li>Alarms go off:
<ul>
<li>Mass centre of the ship has changed, something is attached to the Frostbreaker…</li>
<li>There is an attempt to breach the hull…</li>
<li>Nothing is seen, but the hull is cut open cold…</li>
<li>A flap of the hull is pulled to the outside, opening a hole…</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The crew quickly move to the citadel of the ship once more. They take the metallic egg, inside a Faraday cage, with them. The rest of the ship looses pressure to space.</li>
<li>It will be an uncomfortable week travelling to <a href="../locations/Defiance.md">Defiance</a>, packed inside the citadel, with 2 additional people, and maybe <em>something</em> outside…</li>
</ul>
