### Context {-}

**Hostile** is a tabletop RPG set in a universe that combines elements of gritty science fiction, horror, and political intrigue. It is heavily inspired by the aesthetics and themes of classic 1970s and 1980s sci-fi movies such as "Alien," "Blade Runner," and "Outland." The game is designed to evoke a sense of being on the edge of known space, where human life is cheap, corporate interests dominate, and the unknown looms at every corner.

Space is a hostile environment, not just because of its physical dangers but also due to the socio-political landscape. The game emphasises themes of corporate greed, the expendability of human life in the pursuit of profit, and the struggle of the working class against oppressive systems. Political intrigue plays a significant role, with factions within and between corporations, as well as other groups with their agendas, vying for power and influence.

#### Themes {-}

- **Gritty sci-fi**: Characters are blue collar spacers, working dangerous jobs in the hostility of space. Every hazard is trying to kill characters all the time. Everything in the world that isn’t an active corporate interest is run down, decaying, and stained. Earth is a traditional cyberpunk setting, but in space there is much less "street violence", and cybernetics are generally not reliable. *List of hazards: lack of oxygen, vacuum, radiation, excessive cold, excessive heat, aliens, alien infections, poisonous atmosphere, high pressure atmosphere, high decompression rate and high gravity acceleration in large bodies.*
- **Horror & fear**: A cynical world, filled with everyday people going about their jobs is a common starting point for good horror stories. Humans are not alone in the universe. Alien predators have been found in multiple worlds, and sometimes even in asteroids. Advanced alien societies had their remnants found by earth explorers, but intelligent life is still to be observed. Some theorists say they have been found, and are among us. And none knows when and where aliens will be found.
- **Political intrigue & treachery**: Several factions with their own motives and goals. Everyone is out for their own interests, and they’re trustworthy only so long as their interests align with yours. Everyone assumes that deals will be kept only so long as they’re mutually profitable and relationships will only continue as long as they offer benefits to all parties. Factions are classified in 3 groups:
	- **Technology & resourceful factions**: the strongest group, mostly formed by Mega Corporations and their subsidiaries.
	- **Belief factions**: their Influence is subtle and ideological, mostly formed by religions and conspiracy theorists
	- **Rising authoritative supra-government**: early years of an attempt of Earth governments to regain control from the Mega Corporations hands - the Terran Mandate.

*More detail on the Hostile book, pages 9-10.*

#### Aesthetic {-}

The aesthetic of **Hostile** is defined by its gritty, realistic approach to science fiction. Technology is not clean and advanced but rather functional, often run-down, and always with a practical purpose. Cybernetics are unreliable, and life in space is hazardous, with threats such as lack of oxygen, radiation, and alien infections being commonplace. The setting is designed to feel lived-in, with every location showing signs of wear and decay, reflecting the hard life of those who dwell in space.

#### Relevant history {-}

Based on our current history until present time. From now, until 2225:

- **SWN** book, pages 121-122
- **HTL** setting book, pages 12-22

#### Relevant locations {-}

**HTL** setting book contains details on most of the systems and worlds, corporations, factions, etc.


### System {-}

**Stars Without Number** is a sandbox-style science fiction tabletop RPG that embraces an "old-school renaissance" gaming philosophy, drawing mechanical inspiration from classic RPGs of the 1970s. It's designed to support a wide range of sci-fi adventures, from gritty mercenary actions to space opera, allowing players and game masters significant freedom to shape the game to their interests. Different than old school D&D, SWN has a much simpler class system, with most of the customisation done through background, foci (i.e. feats) and a robust skill system (based on classic Traveler - which is the skill system of the Hostile game too). Additional flavour from other games are always welcomed (OSR compatible preferred, but anything can be discussed): Any rule, class, foci, etc from any OSR game can be considered. [Sine Nomine](https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/publisher/3482/Sine-Nomine-Publishing) books are very easy to integrate with each other. I have a few of them if someone is interested.

##### Mental decay {-}

**Short term (stress)**

PC's individual (short term) stress is abstracted to a game pace mechanics: **Tension Pool**. The **Tension Pool** is managed by the GM.

**Long term (affliction)**

Long term mental decay (i.e. **Afflictions**) happens when it is narratively coherent. Long term mental decay is not a major theme of Hostile, so it will be used sparingly. The GM will ask for a Mental Save when there is a chance to develop an **Affliction** and they will be randomly rolled on the following **MMR** table.

##### Physical decay {-}

**Short term (criticals)**

Upon rolling a natural 20 on an **Attack** roll, deal damage with **2x** the normal damage dice.

**Long term (injuries)**

When PCs are **Mortally Wounded**, they gain an injury. When their **Frailty** is over, they can make a **Physical Save**. If successful their injury is also recovered, otherwise their injury becomes a permanent one. The following table is derived from **Cities Without Number**, for thematic coherence with **Hostile**.

| d12   | Injury                                                              |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | **Gut wound**: -1 penalty to a random physical attribute modifier.  |
| 2     | **Brain damage**: -1 penalty to a random mental attribute modifier. |
| 3     | **Trauma**: Gain an affliction.                                     |
| 4     | One **eye is ruined**.                                              |
| 5-6   | Left (5) or right (6) **leg is ruined**.                            |
| 7-8   | Left (7) or right (8) **arm is ruined**.                            |
| 9-10  | **System damage**: Gain +1 permanent **System Strain**.             |
| 11-12 | **Just a flesh wound**: It's not that bad of a hit after all.       |
