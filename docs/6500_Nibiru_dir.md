# Nibiru

**Nibiru** ([video review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBACC2zOlj8)) is a science fiction RPG centred around amnesia and discovery, set in a massive space station known as Nibiru, which serves as a haven for forgotten memories. Players take on the roles of Vagabonds, individuals who have arrived in Nibiru with no memory of their past, and must explore the station and its bizarre societies to uncover their histories and the secrets of this enigmatic world.

**Themes**

- **Memory**: The theme of memory is central, as characters struggle to piece together fragmented memories and uncover the truth about their pasts. Memory serves as both a tool and a barrier, shaping the characters' identities and driving their actions as they explore the mysteries of the Nibiru.
- **Identity**: In a world where characters' memories are unreliable and their true selves are often obscured, characters must navigate the complexities of identity, grappling with questions of who they are and who they want to become in the face of uncertainty and amnesia.
- **Exploration**: Characters' journey through the vast and enigmatic space station known as the Nibiru. As they do, they uncover hidden secrets, encounter strange creatures, and navigate treacherous environments as they explore the depths of the ship and search for answers about its origins and purpose.

### System {-}

**Best Left Buried** ([video review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3RFTmq4L1U)) emphasises a minimalist rule system designed to foster atmospheric horror and survival tension, prioritising player skill and strategic resource management over character abilities. The game stands out for its focus on the psychological impact of uncanny consequences, where the true enemy is often the fear and madness that comes from uncovering things that are, perhaps, **Best Left Buried**.

#### Character creation {-}
***Reference: Best Left Buried Zine 1***

##### Habitat {-}

PCs têm um Habitat (**NBR** 127-147). Cada Habitat define regras específicas para a recuperação de Memórias e Revelações.

Archetypes e Advancements do **BLB** não vão ser usados diretamente, apenas como inspiração (mecânica) para as Revelações do **NBR**.
##### Stats {-}

Para a criação de personagens basta definir os atributos (**Brawl**, **Wit**, **Will**) e calcular **Vigour** e **Grip**.

PCs start with: `+2` in one stat, `+1` to another and `+0` to the last.

PCs have two resource pools: **Vigour** and **Grip**.
- Max **Vigour** is 6 + **Brawl**
- Starting Grip is 4 + **Will**

#### Advancements {-}

Memory Points (**MP**) são concedidos:
- `+3` base point per session
- `+1` if your PC has faced a dangerous situation

##### Memos System {-}
***Nibiru 112-113***

Cada nova memória custa **5 MP**. Memórias negativas concedem **5 MP** ao PC.

Memórias positivas concedem, na primeira ação relacionada à memória por cena, **The Upper Hand** para o **Stat** check. Por outro lado, memórias negativas concedem **Against The Odds** para o **Stat** check.
##### Revelations {-}
***Nibiru 115-119***

Ao acumular 8 Memórias, o PC ganha uma **Revelação**. Ao ganhar a **Revelação**, os PCs também ganham 1 **Vigour** e **Grip** (efetivamente esse é o Level Up do **Best Left Buried** hackeado com o **Nibiru**). Alternativamente, o jogador pode discutir com o GM e escolher um **Advancement** do **Best Left Buried**.

#### Regras {-}

The resolution mechanics of **BLB** is used, when not stated differently.

Os Influence Points do **NBR** serão substituídos pelo **Grip** do **BLB**.

**Vigour** recovery:  
- Base rate of one recovered **Vigour** per day.
- It a PC does not have appropriate shelter, food or water, recovery is not possible.
- If someone is treating the PC, one additional Vigour is recovered per day upon a successful **Will** check. The check is **Against The Odds** it there are no appropriate supplies or equipment.

#### Consequences {-}
***Reference: Best Left Buried Zine 5***

Gaining consequences work the same way the do on **BLB**. For thematic coherence, **Afflictions** might be chosen from the list of **Becoming Broken** from **NBR** 110.
