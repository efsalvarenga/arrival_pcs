# System

**Terra** is a rules light system focused on narrative, player agency and consequences. Only 6-sided dice are used, in two tones: **Light Dice** and **Dark Dice**.

## Character creation

1. Always start with a **Name** and a **Concept**.
2. Roll for **Attributes**.
3. Calculate **HP** (hit points) and **Ego**.
4. Choose one **Advancement**.

### Attributes

 **Attributes** are grouped in **Body** and **Mind**. Each group has one attribute focused on **Power** and one focused on **Finesse**.

- **Body/Power**: represents physical strength, endurance and might.
- **Body/Finesse**: represents dexterity, precision and physical sagacity.
- **Mind/Power**: represents mental force, willpower and personality heft.
- **Mind/Finesse**: represents reasoning, understanding mental sagacity. 

To determine **Attribute** values, roll 1d for each, and consult the table below. After rolling, you might swap two values.

| Roll           |  1  | 2-3 | 4-5 |  6  |
| -------------- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| **Stat Value** |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |

Your **Attributes** define the initial size of your **Dice Pool** when you are doing something that you are capable of, and have appropriate the equipment.

### HP and Ego

Your character has two measures of survival: **HP** (hit points) and **Ego**.

**HP** (hit points) represent their health, disposition and fighting spirit. To determine your character's starting **HP**, take their **Brawn** and add 5.

**Ego** combines resolve, sanity and protection from Sepsis. It is spent to increase dice pools and used on character **Advancements**, and is depleted when facing psychologically damaging situations or infectious environments. To determine your character's starting **Ego**, take their **Will** and add 5.

## Character development

### Advancements

Every time PCs accumulate 8 XP, they gain an advancement. Alongside an advancement, a PC also gains +1 **Vigour** and +1 **Ego**.
#### General advancements

- **Extra Attribute**: Gain +1 in one chosen **Attribute**. Limit is 2 in the first 10 advancements Limit is 3 thereafter.

## Rules

### Rolling the dice

*Whenever you try to overcome a challenge*, say what you intend to do and roll the **Dice Pool**.

- The player with the GM define what affects the **Dice Pool** size (attributes, skills, environment, conditions, etc.).
- The GM defines if the challenge would retribute (fight back, accidents, etc.) and the the **Retribution** dice pool. Use dice of a colour different from the PC's dice pool.
- The GM defines the challenge **Disposition**. Most simple challenges have a **Disposition** of 1. Complex or long challenges may have a higher value, defined by the GM.

After you roll, choose one die to be your **Success Die**.  

- *1-3 is a failure with complications*: You fail and the challenge might reattribute.
- *4-5 is a success with complications*: You accomplish your goal and apply your effect, but the challenge might retribute.
- *6 is complete success*: You accomplish your goal without retribution.

If you only have one die in your pool, this is your **Success Die**. If you have less than one die in your pool, roll two dice and take the lowest as your **Success Die**.

After determining the **Success Die**, choose another die to be the **Effect Die**. The result shown is the effect (damage, progress in a task, etc.) to be applied to the challenge **Disposition** (hit points, morale, distance travelled, etc.). Once the disposition is matched, the challenge is overcome. If you have one or less dice in your pool and you don't fail, your effect result is always a "1".

**Retribution** should be read as the highest of the Retribution dice.

**Effect** and **Retribution** are exploding dice. Every time the result is a natural 6, re-roll and accumulate the result. Equipment and conditions may modify **Effect** and **Retribution** results. The modified result does not affect dice explosion - which is only when a natural 6 occur.

### Dice pool size

The dice pool size is defined based on the attribute in use, and relevant skill. Take a number of dice equal to your character's attribute and **+1d** if a relevant skill is applicable. Conditions and equipment also modify the size of the dice pool. A generic guideline is given below.

|                  | Minor | Major |
| ---------------- | :---: | :---: |
| **Advantage**    |  +1d  |  +2d  |
| **Disadvantage** |  -1d  |  -2d  |

Weapons, and combat, might require more granular qualities.
### Weapons and armour

Weapons modify the **Dice Pool** and the order that results are read from the dice rolls.

- Light melee: **+1d**, always act first.
- Medium melee: **+1d**, if wielded two-hand **+1** to **Effect** die result.
- Heavy melee: **+2d**, two-handed, always acts last.
- Light ranged: **+1d**.
- Medium ranged: **+2d**, if **Effect** die explodes all ammo is spent.
- Heavy ranged: **+3d**, requires 1 round to aim.
- Improvised: **+0d**, always acts last.

Armour reduce damage taken by the **Retribution** die.

- **Light**: **-1** to **Retribution** die result.
- **Heavy**: **-2** to **Retribution** die result, -1d to run, observe, sneak, swim, etc.
- **Shield**: **-1** to **Retribution** die result, can be sacrificed to completely avoid the **Retribution** die.
### Harm, recovery and death

When the **Retribution** your character receives is a direct physical hit, the character is harmed - and you reduce the **Retribution** result from **HP**. However, if the character was not in physical danger, if Retribution is equal or greater than Ego, reduce ego in one.

Players always have a choice to avoid an entire instance of **HP** and **Ego** reduction by taking, respectively, an **Injury** or a **Sepsis Infestation**. These consequences are permanent.

**HP** recovers at the rate of one per day. If a PC does not have appropriate shelter, food or water, recovery is not possible. If someone is treating the PC, one additional **HP** is recovered.

Players choose when to recover **Ego**. Each **Sepsis Infestation** taken recovers 10 **Ego**.
