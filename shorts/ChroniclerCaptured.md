# Chronicler Captured

This reference document is focused on playing a short adventure on the **Degenesis: Rebirth** setting on a homebrew system currently called **Terra**. This document is mostly self-contained. The Degenesis: Rebirth books (Primal Punk & Katharsys) add flavour to the setting (see appendices for reference links).


# Context
***Reference: Defenesis Rebirth Primal Punk***

[Chroniclers](https://youtu.be/8aZRkjvtaow?t=1070&si=oKga2q224Bxts8A-) are one of the cults in Degenesis. You are a member of this clan and, during a trade with a [Scavenger](https://youtu.be/8aZRkjvtaow?t=1505&si=rbZX7a_4gqETiMJq) in east [Borca](https://youtu.be/8aZRkjvtaow?t=385&si=6nA1LdZBrvom6fY9), you were captured. You wake up in a dark and humid room.


# System

**Terra** is a rules light system focused on narrative, player agency and consequences. Only d6s are used, in two different colours.

## Character creation

1. Always start with a **Name** and a **Concept** - see Concepts.
2. Roll for **Attributes** (**Brawn**, **Wit** and **Will**) - see Attributes.
3. Calculate **Vigour** and **Ego** - see Vigour and Ego.
4. You are a **Chronicler**. Your initial skills are Crafting, Negotiation, Engineering, Artifact Lore and Deception.
5. Based on your **Concept**, write down two additional skills you are good at.
6. Choose one **Advancement** (See Character advancements below).

### Attributes

PCs have three **Attributes**: **Brawn**, **Wit** and **Will**.

- **Brawn** represents the character’s physical strength, endurance and vital force.
- **Wit** represents a character’s physical, mental and social agility.
- **Will** represents a character’s intellect and the power of their mind.

To determine their values, roll 1d6 for each, and consult the table below. After rolling, you can swap two values.

| Roll           | 1-3 | 4-5 |  6  |
| -------------- | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| **Stat Value** |  1  |  2  |  3  |

Your **Attributes** define the initial size of your dice pool, **+1d** if you are using a relevant skill.

### Vigour and Ego

Your character has two measures of survival: **Vigour** and **Ego**.

**Vigour** is like other games’ hit points, and represents their health, disposition and fighting spirit. To determine your character's starting **Vigour**, take their **Brawn** and add 5.

**Ego** combines resolve, sanity and protection from Sepsis. It is spent to increase dice pools and used on character **Advancements**, and is depleted when facing psychologically damaging situations or infectious environments. To determine your character's starting **Ego**, take their **Will** and add 5.

## Character development

### Consequences

## Rules

### Rolling the dice

*Whenever you try to overcome a challenge*, say what you intend to do and roll the **Dice Pool**.

- The player with the GM define what affects the **Dice Pool** size (attributes, skills, environment, conditions, etc.).
- The GM defines if the challenge would retribute (fight back, accidents, etc.) and the the **Retribution** dice pool. Use dice of a colour different from the PC's dice pool.
- The GM defines the challenge **Disposition**. Most simple challenges have a **Disposition** of 1. Complex or long challenges may have a higher value, defined by the GM.

After you roll, choose one die to be your **Success Die**.  

- *1-3 is a failure with complications*: You fail and the challenge might reattribute.
- *4-5 is a success with complications*: You accomplish your goal and apply your effect, but the challenge might retribute.
- *6 is complete success*: You accomplish your goal without retribution.

If you only have one die in your pool, this is your **Success Die**. If you have less than one die in your pool, roll two dice and take the lowest as your **Success Die**.

After determining the **Success Die**, choose another die to be the **Effect Die**. The result shown is the effect (damage, progress in a task, etc.) to be applied to the challenge **Disposition** (hit points, morale, distance travelled, etc.). Once the disposition is matched, the challenge is overcome. If you have one or less dice in your pool and you don't fail, your effect result is always a "1".

**Retribution** should be read as the highest of the Retribution dice.

**Effect** and **Retribution** are exploding dice. Every time the result is a natural 6, re-roll and accumulate the result. Equipment and conditions may modify **Effect** and **Retribution** results. The modified result does not affect dice explosion - which is only when a natural 6 occur.

### Recovery

**Vigour** recovers at the rate of one per day. If a PC does not have appropriate shelter, food or water, recovery is not possible. If someone is treating the PC, one additional Vigour is recovered per day upon a successful **Will** check.

Players choose when to recover **Ego**. Each **Sepsis Infestation** taken recovers 10 **Ego**.

# Equipment

Use of equipment change your **Dice Pool**.

## Weapons and armour

Weapons modify the **Dice Pool** and the order that results are read from the dice rolls.

- Light melee: **+1d**, always act first.
- Medium melee: **+1d**, if wielded two-hand **+1** to **Effect** die result.
- Heavy melee: **+2d**, two-handed, always acts last.
- Light ranged: **+1d**.
- Medium ranged: **+2d**, if **Effect** die explodes all ammo is spent.
- Heavy ranged: **+3d**, requires 1 round to aim.
- Improvised: **+0d**, always acts last.

Armour reduce damage taken by the **Retribution** die.

- **Light**: **-1** to **Retribution** die result.
- **Heavy**: **-2** to **Retribution** die result, -1d to run, observe, sneak, swim, etc.
- **Shield**: **-1** to **Retribution** die result, can be sacrificed to completely avoid the **Retribution** die.
