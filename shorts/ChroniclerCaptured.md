# Chronicler Captured

This reference document is focused on playing a short adventure on the **Degenesis: Rebirth** setting, on the chassis of **Best Left Buried** and **World of Dungeons**. This document is mostly self-contained. The following books can be used to expand understanding.

# Context
***Reference: Defenesis Rebirth Primal Punk***

[Chroniclers](https://youtu.be/8aZRkjvtaow?t=1070&si=oKga2q224Bxts8A-) are one of the cults in Degenesis. You are a member of this clan and, during a trade with a [Scavenger](https://youtu.be/8aZRkjvtaow?t=1505&si=rbZX7a_4gqETiMJq) in east [Borca](https://youtu.be/8aZRkjvtaow?t=385&si=6nA1LdZBrvom6fY9), you were captured. You wake up in a dark and humid room.

# System

The game will use a hybrid system between **BLB** and **WuDu**. 
## Character creation
***Reference: Best Left Buried Zine 1***

1. Always start with a **Name** and a **Concept** (see Character concepts below).
2. Roll for **Stats** (**Brawn**, **Wit** and **Will**).
3. Calculate **Vigour** (6 + **Brawn**) and **Grip** (4 + **Will**).
3. Based on your **Concept**, choose one action type to be good at, and one to be bad at. Action types are specific applications of generic skills (see **BLB** Zine 2 for examples for each Archetype).
4. Choose one **Advancement** (See Character advancements below).
### Stats

PCs have three **Stats**: **Brawn**, **Wit** and **Will**.

- **Brawn** represents the character’s physical strength, endurance and vital force.
- **Wit** represents a character’s physical, mental and social agility.
- **Will** represents a character’s intellect and the power of their mind.

To determine their values, roll 2d6 for each, and consult the table below. After rolling, you can swap two values.

| Roll           | 2   | 3-6 | 7-9 | 10-11 | 12  |
| -------------- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :---: | :-: |
| **Stat Value** | -1  | 0   | +1  | +2    | +3  |

If a **Stat** is positive, add it to any **Stat Checks** using it; conversely subtract a negative **Stat** from **Stat Checks** using it.
### Vigour and Grip

Your character has two measures of survival: **Vigour** and **Grip**.

**Vigour** is like other games’ hit points, and represents their health disposition and fighting spirit. To determine your character's starting **Vigour**, take their **Brawn** and add 6.

**Grip** combines stamina, sanity and protection from Sepsis. It is spent on re-rolls and used on character Advancements, and is depleted when facing psychologically damaging monsters or
Infectious environments. To determine your character's starting **Grip**, take their Will **and** add 4.

The mechanics implementation of character archetypes will follow the Everyman Archetype (**BLB** Zine 2). Choose one action type your character is good at, and one they are bad at. Action types are specific applications of generic skills. For an action type the PC is good at, roll the **Stat Check** with the **Upper Hand**. Conversely, for an action type the PC is bad at, roll the **Stat Check** **Against the Odds**.
## Character development

### Advancements

Every time PCs accumulate 8 xp, they gain an advancement. Alongside an advancement, a PC also gains +1 **Vigour** and +1 **Grip**.
#### General advancements

- **Extra Stat** (**BLB** Zine 2): Gain +1 in one chosen stat. Limit is +2 in the first 10 advancements Limit is +3 thereafter.
- **Extra Grip** (**BLB** Zine 2): Gain +3 **Grip**.

#### Cult-specific advancements

**Chroniclers** (**DEG** KatharSys 53)

![](https://i.imgur.com/5PiOTYa.png)

- **Tesla** : Spend 1 to 3 **Grip** and an action to make a **Will** based Attack with the **Upper Hand** against an enemy within short range. Multiply the damage by the **Grip** cost.
- **Nova**: For 1 **Grip** and an action in combat, the PC fogs a number of creatures up to their **Will**. The next roll of these creatures are made **Against the Odds**.
- **Dead End**: When the PC **Attacks** an enemy who is unaware of them, they have the **Upper Hand** and deal double damage.
- **Fractal Memory**: Roll with the **Upper Hand** on memory related actions.
- **Download**: Roll with the Upper Hand when questioning a prisoner NPC.
- **Upload**: Roll with the Upper Hand when trying to incept an idea on an NPC

### Consequences
***Reference: Best Left Buried Zine 5 and Metamorphica Revised***

Gaining consequences work the same way the do on **BLB**. Unlike in **BLB**, afflictions will be used to expose Sepsis infestation - as opposed to character flaws and insanity.
