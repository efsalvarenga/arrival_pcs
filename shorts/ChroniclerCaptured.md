# Context
***Reference: Defenesis Rebirth Primal Punk***

[Chroniclers](https://youtu.be/8aZRkjvtaow?t=1070&si=oKga2q224Bxts8A-) are one of the cults in Degenesis. You are a member of this clan and, during a trade with a [Scavenger](https://youtu.be/8aZRkjvtaow?t=1505&si=rbZX7a_4gqETiMJq) in east [Borca](https://youtu.be/8aZRkjvtaow?t=385&si=6nA1LdZBrvom6fY9), you were captured. You wake up in a dark and humid room.

# System

The game will use a hybrid system between **BLB** and **WuDu**. 
## Character creation
***Reference: Best Left Buried Zine 1***

1. Always start with a **Name** and a **Concept** (see Character concepts below).
2. Roll for **Stats** (**Brawn**, **Wit** and **Will**).
3. Calculate **Vigour** (6 + **Brawn**) and **Grip** (4 + **Will**).
3. Based on your **Concept**, choose one action type to be good at, and one to be bad at. Action types are specific applications of generic skills (see **BLB** Zine 2 for examples for each Archetype).
4. Choose one **Advancement** (See Character advancements below).
### Stats

PCs have three **Stats**: **Brawn**, **Wit** and **Will**.

- **Brawn** represents the character’s physical strength, endurance and vital force.
- **Wit** represents a character’s physical, mental and social agility.
- **Will** represents a character’s intellect and the power of their mind.

To determine their values, roll 2d6 for each, and consult the table below. After rolling, you can swap two values.

| Roll           | 2   | 3-6 | 7-9 | 10-11 | 12  |
| -------------- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :---: | :-: |
| **Stat Value** | -1  | 0   | +1  | +2    | +3  |

If a **Stat** is positive, add it to any **Stat Checks** using it; conversely subtract a negative **Stat** from **Stat Checks** using it.
### Vigour and Grip

Your character has two measures of survival: **Vigour** and **Grip**.

**Vigour** is like other games’ hit points, and represents their health disposition and fighting spirit. To determine your character's starting **Vigour**, take their **Brawn** and add 6.

**Grip** combines stamina, sanity and protection from Sepsis. It is spent on re-rolls and used on character Advancements, and is depleted when facing psychologically damaging monsters or
Infectious environments. To determine your character's starting **Grip**, take their Will **and** add 4.

The mechanics implementation of character concepts will follow **BLB**'s Everyman Archetype (**BLB** Zine 2). Choose one action type your character is good at, and one they are bad at. Action types are specific applications of generic skills. For an action type the PC is good at, roll the **Stat Check** with the **Upper Hand**. Conversely, for an action type the PC is bad at, roll the **Stat Check** **Against the Odds**.
## Character development

### Advancements

Every time PCs accumulate 8 XP, they gain an advancement. Alongside an advancement, a PC also gains +1 **Vigour** and +1 **Grip**.
#### General advancements

- **Extra Stat** (**BLB** Zine 2): Gain +1 in one chosen stat. Limit is +2 in the first 10 advancements Limit is +3 thereafter.
- **Extra Grip** (**BLB** Zine 2): Gain +3 **Grip**.

#### Cult-specific advancements

**Chroniclers** (**DEG** KatharSys 53)

![](https://i.imgur.com/5PiOTYa.png)

- **Tesla** : Spend 1 to 3 **Grip** and an action to make a **Will** based Attack with the **Upper Hand** against an enemy within short range. Multiply the damage by the **Grip** cost.
- **Nova**: For 1 **Grip** and an action in combat, the PC fogs a number of creatures up to their **Will**. The next roll of these creatures are made **Against the Odds**.
- **Dead End**: When the PC **Attacks** an enemy who is unaware of them, they have the **Upper Hand** and deal double damage.
- **Fractal Memory**: Roll with the **Upper Hand** on memory related actions.
- **Download**: Roll with the Upper Hand when questioning a prisoner NPC.
- **Upload**: Roll with the Upper Hand when trying to incept an idea on an NPC

### Consequences
***Reference: Best Left Buried Zine 5 and Metamorphica Revised***

Gaining consequences work the same way the do on **BLB**. Unlike in **BLB**, afflictions will be used to expose Sepsis infestation - as opposed to character flaws and insanity.

## Rules
***Reference: Best Left Buried Zine 4 and World of Dungeons***

### Rolling the dice

**When you attempt something risky**, roll 2d6 and add one of your **Stats**, based on the action you’re taking - this is called a **Stat Check**. **Observation Checks** are unmodified by **Stats**. ***6- is a failure***; things don’t go well and the risk turns out badly. ***7-9 is a minor success***; you do it, but there’s some cost, compromise, retribution, harm, etc. ***10+ is a major success***; you do it without complications.

The **Target Numbers** never change. If the GM wishes to make the situation harder or easier, apply the **Upper Hand** or **Against The Odds**. With the **Upper Hand**, roll 3d6 and discard the lowest die before adding the appropriate **Stat**. Conversely, when **Against The Odds**, roll 3d6 and discard the highest die before adding the appropriate **Stat**.

For **Attacks** roll 3d6. Choose two of the dice and add the appropriate **Stat** for this type of **Attack**. ***6- is a failure***; you miss your enemy while they hurt you, or something else bad happens. ***7-9 is a partial success***; you hit an enemy that counter attacks you, or you hit and something else bad happens. ***10+ is a full success***; you hit the enemy and avoid counter attacks.

On a hit, the remaining die serves as damage. The attacker's weapon modifiers are added, while the enemy's armour rating is subtracted from the damage die, before applying it to the target's **Vigour**. When the damage die is a 6, the target must roll on the **Injury** table.

### Recovery

The base rate of one recovered **Vigour** per day. If a PC does not have appropriate shelter, food or water, recovery is not possible. If someone is treating the PC, one additional Vigour is recovered per day upon a successful **Will** check. The check is **Against The Odds** it there are no appropriate supplies and equipment.
