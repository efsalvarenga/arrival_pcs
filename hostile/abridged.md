# Abridged

## Prelude

Advanced alien ruins were found in 2223 in the Perdurabo system. An ice sample was bought by Tharsis' Parkfield Biolabs, which contained RNA that can be used to cure early dementia caused by frequent faster than light travel. The RNA named Neuroplasticity Augmentor Sequence (NAS-RNA), however, the RNA cannot be easily replicated in laboratory. For this reason, the discovery was not made public yet, and Tharsis has been moving fast to evaluate the feasibility to establish an ice mine in the system.

If proven feasible, the existence of the Brightside Mining Station in the system is an advantage. The station is a poorly managed facility that would be easy to purchase if the exploration proves commerciality of the play (see Hostile-Setting 82, for detail on the licensing process).

Perdurabo is a system blazing with the murderous light of a red giant star. The hard-bitten miners of the Brightside Mining Station maintain the only outpost of civilisation in a system filled with lethal light and stellar outlaws. Ancient asteroid sky tombs lie in the vicinity while a seething rebellion boils beneath Brightside Station's steel skin.

You are the crew going to Perdurabo. You main goal is to execute the Exploration Framework that enables the commercial evaluation of the Ice Mine play. Non-disclosed milestones, that will be paid off books, is infiltrating and deteriorating the leadership of Brightside station, so its later acquisition is even cheaper.

On the evening before the mission kick-off meeting with Tharsis Mining Manager for Ice Exploration John McLeod, the crew find a scientist from Haruna tied to a bomb in the toilets of a bar in French Guiana. They learn of the animosity of the Lebkuchen activists against Haruna's cloning endeavours. After all that is sorted, they decide to bet on Olaf in a boxing ring, which proves to be successful.

On the next day they finally meet with John McLeod, and preparations for the travel to Perdurabo start.

## Chapter 01 The Frostbreaker

- The Doomborgs crew arrives in Brightside. Brightside is a space mining station owned by [Haruna](https://i.imgur.com/xla77J1.png), part of the [Matsuyama](https://i.imgur.com/VY7zssZ.png) group.
- The crew meets a few of the faces on the station and take a space raft to their own ship, which is stationary close by Brightside.
- After a quick inspection, the Frostbreaker seems in order, and the crew get back to Brightside to sign paperwork.
- While mingling a bit more with the inhabitants of the station, they end up befriending Marius, a scientific representative from [Makita](https://i.imgur.com/bVblDuU.png) (part of the [Wu-Ketai](https://i.imgur.com/QEu2vfo.png) group). He is invited for a mission launch party onboard the Frostbreaker and, on the way there, the crew also invites Roland.
- Everyone gets drunk and drugged and some information is learned: Marius thinks his job is demeaning while Roland has data that incriminates Yash (Brightside Director) of embezzlement.
- In the following morning the crew have a virtual meeting with John McLeod, who is unhappy that some information might have leaked about the intention to drill ice in the asteroid. Olaf takes a decision to visit one of the sky tombs in the region, to pretend the crew is one of adventurers and dismiss questions.
- The crew goes back and negotiate with Marius and Ranse, and they purchase the coordinates of one of the sky tombs that could possess some riches.

**MadSpark's version of the story**
> ***MadSpark doesn’t remember much of this, his version of events goes as follows***
> - arrived at a space station after a boring travel but made a neat little BB Gun from my seatbelt
> - got told to put my shotgun in a locker (but luckily kept my hunting knife)
> - found some great spare parts for the little drone I’ve been planning to make 
> - the ship has a basic but adequately equipped workshop, so started work on the drone 
> - everyone wanted to explore the space station & I needed a drink anyway so off we went 
> - then there were some of these guys who had a bug in their asses about something to do with stealing (apparently it’s not allowed here… 🤷🏼‍♂️) but the skipper sorted it out & then we headed to the bar (it’s interesting that the cameras here are ATX18956 model - I haven’t seen those of years, I’ll have to take one apart at some point for nostalgic reasons)
> - I bought drinks all night & did that trick with the exploding gunpowder shots - I don’t remember much after that
> - Oh yeah, we’re going to see if we can find some valuable alien artefacts to make some extra moolah 💰(sounds more interesting than the mission anyway!)

## Chapter 02 The Cold Tomb

- The Doomborgs crew arrive in the Cold Tomb. The structure was built in an ice chunk in one of the asteroids in the Perdurabo system.
- The ship is docked in the entrance of the tomb, and Olaf and Oliver suit up and are ready in the air lock. Through a scan they know that beyond the tomb entrance door the environment is filled with icy water.
- The two crewmen venture inside, with a system of communication and power umbilicals and a 50 meter harness cable. Sabaka stays behind in the airlock ready to rewind the cable if necessary.
- In the entrance room, shaped like a sphere, they record on their cameras alien language carved in the icy wall, and an image depicting a blurred humanoid alien in what seems like a position of power.
- While this was happening, MadSpark feels the need of action, and leaves the ship in a second airlock. While investigating the surroundings of the construction, he detects faint biological matter readings on his suit. He communicates that to Olaf and Oliver, who now turn on their precise detectors too, receiving the same readings.
- The crew hypothesise that the readings are coming from the water (melted from the asteroid ice), and take a sample from inside the tomb. MadSpark gets back on the ship and take the sample to the lab. He starts to feel dizzy.
- In the tomb, Oliver and Olaf reach another room where they find dozens of alien bodies floating in the water. They quickly grab one and, in a haste movement, decide to retreat to the spaceship.
- On their way back, a drone swims in their direction and shoots a shard of metal in their direction, but the crewmen were faster and lock themselves in the airlock before the drone can enter. Oni skillfully undock the Frostbreaker from the tomb and pilot the ship back to Brightside.
- After decontaminating the air, Olaf and Oliver join the crew in the ship again, but now everyone is feeling slightly sick, unfocused and dizzy.
- On the way back, some movement readings withing the starship structure alert Oni. The crew quickly retreat to the citadel and command the ship from there. They soon see in the cameras a dozens crab-like alien creatures exploring she starship. 
- MadSpark flushes the starship atmosphere. At the same time Olaf starts to feel very sick and anxious. He thinks for a brief moment that MadSpark is flushing the citadel and panics. The other crew members calm him down, and they all see the crab creatures passing out.
- Upon arrival in Brightside, Yash Dutta does not allow the immediate off boarding of the crew due to contamination risk, and Olaf decides to speak with John McLeod. John quickly decides that the finding is too high profile, and the Doomborgs are ordered to immediatelly travel back to Earth.
- After a failed attempt to threat Yash, the Frostbreaker departs from Brightside. The destination is the Teegarden’s Star system, where in the main world (Defiance) a remote office of Tharsis and the ICO (Interstellar Commerce Organisation) are available.

## Chapter 03 The Boxer

- The Doomborgs crew travel to the neighbour system: the Teegarden's Star. During the spike drill, Bennet used the time to execute a biopsy on one of the crab creatures that infested the starship previously. The doctor was very unlucky when a splash of acid hits his eyes, blinding him.
- Upon arriving on Teegarden's Star, the captain makes contact with the system control and gets redirected to the Tharsis Mining office on the [Defiance](https://sectorswithoutnumber.com/sector/E9FKrPjS8tsRmoryYMpe/planet/UBzrpfVGWXxJZq6C9ndC). A shuttle picks the crew from orbit and a truck and a car takes them and the corpse to the corporation estate.
- The Doomborgs meet Lucas, a rough operations coordinator in the system, who explains next steps: they are to complete the mining contract as fast as possible, avoiding any further information leak. The Boxer crew, a group of mercenaries, will be responsible for collecting the remaining corpses and taking them to Earth.
- While the meeting goes on, Bennet is in the hospital, and learns his eyes are doomed. He will need a cybernetic implant, and that can be arranged within a week.
- The crew meets again, and decide that waiting a week would be too long. Sabaka connects on the dark web and finds a fixer that can help them get a second hand cybereyes set within a day. The Doomborgs agree with the fixer and go to the appointed location, a district nightclub.
- In the nightclub they meet an energetic girl, who are to guide them getting the second hand cybereyes - from someone wearing it! They get into a VIP booth, where the target is having fun with what looks like a prostitute. The crew is swift and put the target on the floor, while the girl they just met "pops off" his eyes.
- The group successfully drive to a shady cybernetic clinic where Bennet has his new eyes implanted. They are ready to continue their mining contract now, and travel back to Perdurabo.
- In the Cold Tomb, they find the Leadbelly docked tot he tomb, while The Boxer's ship - the Brutomaker - is docked to the second airlock of the Leadbelly. Oni docks the Frostbreaker to the Brutomaker.
- MadSpark starts the first drone, but an issue with setting the explosives on the ice chunk means that drone is lost in space.
- Olaf speaks with The Boxer over comms, and they agree to meet and trade a drone from the Brutomaker.
- The Doomborg meets The Boxer and his crew, while they loot the Cold Tomb and move the valuables to the Brutomaker. The crew of the Leadbelly is tied up and gagged, and left in the Leadbelly for the Doomborgs to figure out.
- Then, suddenly, while being playful with the new drone, cause an accident and an oxygen leak in the Brutomaker. The two crews start running, but most of The Boxer's crew was further in the aft of the starship, and are lost to space with everything in that part of the ship when it explodes.
- Bennet and MadSpark are safe in the Frostbreaker, while Oni, Olaf and Sabaka - together with TheBoxer and his engineer and the hostages - are safe in the Leadbelly.
