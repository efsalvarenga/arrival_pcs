# Abridged

## Prelude

Advanced alien ruins were found in 2223 in the Perdurabo system. An ice sample was bought by Tharsis' Parkfield Biolabs, which contained RNA that can be used to cure early dementia caused by frequent faster than light travel. The RNA named Neuroplasticity Augmentor Sequence (NAS-RNA), however, the RNA cannot be easily replicated in laboratory. For this reason, the discovery was not made public yet, and Tharsis has been moving fast to evaluate the feasibility to establish an ice mine in the system.

If proven feasible, the existence of the Brightside Mining Station in the system is an advantage. The station is a poorly managed facility that would be easy to purchase if the exploration proves commerciality of the play (see Hostile-Setting 82, for detail on the licensing process).

Perdurabo is a system blazing with the murderous light of a red giant star. The hard-bitten miners of the Brightside Mining Station maintain the only outpost of civilisation in a system filled with lethal light and stellar outlaws. Ancient asteroid sky tombs lie in the vicinity while a seething rebellion boils beneath Brightside Station's steel skin.

You are the crew going to Perdurabo. You main goal is to execute the Exploration Framework that enables the commercial evaluation of the Ice Mine play. Non-disclosed milestones, that will be paid off books, is infiltrating and deteriorating the leadership of Brightside station, so its later acquisition is even cheaper.

On the evening before the mission kick-off meeting with Tharsis Mining Manager for Ice Exploration John McLeod, the crew find a scientist from Haruna tied to a bomb in the toilets of a bar in French Guiana. They learn of the animosity of the Lebkuchen activists against Haruna's cloning endeavours. After all that is sorted, they decide to bet on Olaf in a boxing ring, which proves to be successful.

On the next day they finally meet with John McLeod, and preparations for the travel to Perdurabo start.

## Chapter 01 The Frostbreaker

- The Doomborgs crew arrives in Brightside. Brightside is a space mining station owned by [Haruna](https://i.imgur.com/xla77J1.png), part of the [Matsuyama](https://i.imgur.com/VY7zssZ.png) group.
- The crew meets a few of the faces on the station and take a space raft to their own ship, which is stationary close by Brightside.
- After a quick inspection, the Frostbreaker seems in order, and the crew get back to Brightside to sign paperwork.
- While mingling a bit more with the inhabitants of the station, they end up befriending Marius, a scientific representative from [Makita](https://i.imgur.com/bVblDuU.png) (part of the [Wu-Ketai](https://i.imgur.com/QEu2vfo.png) group). He is invited for a mission launch party onboard the Frostbreaker and, on the way there, the crew also invites Roland.
- Everyone gets drunk and drugged and some information is learned: Marius thinks his job is demeaning while Roland has data that incriminates Yash (Brightside Director) of embezzlement.
- In the following morning the crew have a virtual meeting with John McLeod, who is unhappy that some information might have leaked about the intention to drill ice in the asteroid. Olaf takes a decision to visit one of the sky tombs in the region, to pretend the crew is one of adventurers and dismiss questions.
- The crew goes back and negotiate with Marius and Ranse, and they purchase the coordinates of one of the sky tombs that could possess some riches.

**MadSpark's version of the story**
> ***MadSpark doesn’t remember much of this, his version of events goes as follows***
> - arrived at a space station after a boring travel but made a neat little BB Gun from my seatbelt
> - got told to put my shotgun in a locker (but luckily kept my hunting knife)
> - found some great spare parts for the little drone I’ve been planning to make 
> - the ship has a basic but adequately equipped workshop, so started work on the drone 
> - everyone wanted to explore the space station & I needed a drink anyway so off we went 
> - then there were some of these guys who had a bug in their asses about something to do with stealing (apparently it’s not allowed here… 🤷🏼‍♂️) but the skipper sorted it out & then we headed to the bar (it’s interesting that the cameras here are ATX18956 model - I haven’t seen those of years, I’ll have to take one apart at some point for nostalgic reasons)
> - I bought drinks all night & did that trick with the exploding gunpowder shots - I don’t remember much after that
> - Oh yeah, we’re going to see if we can find some valuable alien artefacts to make some extra moolah 💰(sounds more interesting than the mission anyway!)
