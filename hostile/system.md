Stars Without Numbers (SWN) is an OSR system, which allows me to easily reskin a lot published materials since the 80s. Different than old school D&D, SWN has a much simpler class system, with most of the customisation done through background, foci (i.e. feats) and a robust skill system (based on classic Traveler - which is the skill system of the Hostile game too). For SWN I can easily convert any D&D adventure (any version, easier with up to 2e), and Call of Cthulhu (d100 systems) with some small work. Additional flavour from other games are always welcomed (OSR compatible preferred, but anything can be discussed): Any rule, class, foci, etc from any OSR game can be considered. [Sine Nomine](https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/publisher/3482/Sine-Nomine-Publishing) books are very easy to integrate with each other. I have a few of them if someone is interested.

# Hazards

Hazard effects from Hostile Rules (65-87) used, which are significantly more detailed.

| Hazard                       | Damage                    | Save             | Details                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Vacuum                       | 3d6/round                 | Physical halves  |                                                |
| Falling                      | 1d6/2m per 1g             | Physical halves  |                                                |

# Grip
***Humanity, Sanity and Willpower, based on [Silent Legion's Madness](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CexCpDNKNSMNnkGgDNrVne1gG-03L5dm&usp=drive_fs)***

*Bloodshed, exposure to horror and pushing oneself to accomplish feats humans would have failed can break havoc in the minds of mundane creatures, consuming their **Grip**. The best that most sufferers can do is to accept a **Delirium**, creating a zone of scorched reason to serve as a buffer against the awareness of the cruel and impossible.*

## Grip score

The **Grip** maximum score is set as the **average between Intelligence and Wisdom, multiplied by 5 - respecting a minimum of 50 and maximum of 90**. If the current **Grip** ever reaches 0 the character is hopelessly lost in their own tormented perceptions and can no longer function as a player character.

## Grip checks, and loosing grip

Once per scene, the GM might require PCs to make a **Grip** check: a d100 roll under the current **Grip** score. On a failure the PC looses **Grip** as per table below. The check might be triggered by bloodshed or horror events. Alternatively, the player can choose to expend 1d4 **Grip** to re-roll a failed attribute, skill, attack or saving throw check. In a single scene, a character can lose no more **Grip** score than the (non cumulative) maximum result of the worst shock they confront.

```
-----------------------------
   EXAMPLES OF GRIP COSTS  
-----------------------------

--------- WILLPOWER ---------
  1d6   Supress the immediate effects of a Delirium
  1d8   Expend one's Grip to re-roll a check: attribute, skill, attack or saving throw
	    (Can only be used once per scene and does not require a humanity check)

----- HUMANITY / SANITY -----
  1d4   Seing a human corpse for the first time
		Shell-shock from battle or explosions, including magical
		Studying the works of a lunatic
  1d6   Killing human beings not in immediate self-defense
		Witnessing a scene of gruesome slaughter
		Being affected by a hostile magic effect
		Witnessing a rarionally impossible event or object
		Witnessing a magical cult ritual
  1d8   Suffering mutilation or torture
		Witnessing the violent death of a friend or close ally
		Abandoning living allies to cultists or otherwordly entities
		Learning of a horrible fate for a friend or close ally
		Reading text from an eldritch language
		Encountering a gargantuan-sized beast or monster
  2d6   Indirectly killing many people by action or omission
		Move between realities
		Realising you have a modified memory
		Being haunted or encountering a mind-bending monster
  2d8   Hearing an eldritch entity speak
		Discovering forbidden or ancient arcane knowledge
 2d10   Experiencing a major supernatural event

```

## Deliria, and recovering Grip

**Players might choose to accept a Delirium** for their characters to recover **Grip**. The player can choose what delirium they get (see material below) or roll randomly in a chosen table. It is easier to choose the new Delirium in-between sessions, and discuss the roleplay and mechanical results with the GM.

**Deliria examples and references (non comprehensive)**
- 5e's long term of indefinite madness [tables](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/madness)
- 3.5e SRD variant indefinite insanity [table 6-11](https://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/campaigns/sanity.htm)
- Ravenloft's [dark gifts](https://5e.tools/book.html#vrgr,1,dark%20gift%20descriptions,0)
- Call of Cthulhu's [phobias and manias](https://cthulhuwiki.chaosium.com/rules/sanity.html#sample-phobias-and-manias)
- Silent Legions' [sample deliria](https://i.imgur.com/pHGjaC1.png)
- Best Left Buried's [afflictions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gMvMcuhIFXWkvjqnP8e-XpcMVObmRVrY/view) (zine 5)

After taking the Delirum the player **rolls 1d20; if the roll is equal or greater than their total number of Deliria** then the newfound structure and rationalisation soothes their mind, **recovering 10 Grip**. If the roll is less than their total number of Deliria, then the fresh insanity just makes everything worse, and 10 points of sanity are lost. Once accrued, Deliria can never be lost.

Some Deliria come with phobias and compulsions. A PC can resist the phobia or compulsion by making a successful **Grip** Check. On a failure, he or she must obey the Delirium unless they are willing to lose 1d6 **Grip** for defying the structure they have fashioned.

# Character advancement

Required XP will use a higher inclination curve (without impact in progress pace), akin traditional OSR. This allows new characters to progress rather quickly to catch up with veterans. XP awarded will be scaled to the dangers the PCs faced on each session.

## Character replacements

Replacements will start at level 1.

# Equipment lists

- Equipment from the SWN book is considered the standard most common equipment available.
	- We are in year 2225, which means the maximum available technology is TL4 (SWN 63)
- More specific items, such as those from Hostile books, will cost their $ value in credits, sometimes being significantly more expensive than common equipment.
	- [Hostile Setting](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fJPqFVlO9pqcjg7lMVgE9lAy4_vml6pW&usp=drive_fs) for generic equipment
	- [Hostile Toolkits](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fL8DRXAaHosQ6aXeTCiIC1YKSVjhVCgk&usp=drive_fs) for specific equipment (includes explosives)
	- [Hostile Gun Locker](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fKPO19H1ZY4RAQoknhycMyO8sL4MN02V&usp=drive_fs) for weapons

# Space travel time

| Destination            | Travel time    |
| ---------------------- | -------------- |
| Within a region        | 6 hours/drive  |
| Between regions        | 48 hours/drive |
| Between hexes (prep)   | 30 min         |
| Between hexes (travel) | 6 days/drive   | 

# Mining 

All below assumes a 24h (2 12h shift) operations. Each shift must make it roll once for the entire job.

- Locate suitable ice chunk: Int/programme DC 8, takes 1d6 days
- Scan the topology for mapping surface area and composition of the entire chunk: Int/Programme or Int/Know DC 8, takes 1d6 days
- Travel to the rock (150 - Int/Pilot check), then a new rock in the same chunk takes 1d6 x 5h. **Each rock has a 1-in-6 chance of having a sky tomb.**
- Each shift a crew member is appointed as mining supervisor. GM rolls Cha or Wis /Fix 2d6 and checks for a mining problem.
- Geology and sampling (1d6 + 3 are required in different rocks, at least two different chunks)
	- Drill with logging tool (EVA or drone): Dex if EVA, Int if drone, Programme or Pilot DC 8, takes 1d6h per drill.
	- Evaluate logs, Int/Know DC 7, takes 1d6h - roll asteroid yield once per chunk. If the rock has a sky tomb, the RNA is found in the ice.
	- Set explosives and net (EVA or drone): Dex/Programme or Dex/Pilot DC 10, takes 1d3 hours.
	- Extract (drones): Int/Programme or Int/Pilot DC 8, takes 1d6 hours

| 4     | 1d12       | Entire sector           | Multi-region             |
| 5     | 1d20       | Multi-sector and more   | Realm and more           |

Features costs are based on (S/W/C)WN asset costs. Each feature has a number of points equal to its type level (1 to 8) divided by 2.

Restore cohesion: $cost = 2^{power}$
