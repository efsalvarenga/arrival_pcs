Stars Without Numbers (SWN) is an OSR system, which allows me to easily reskin a lot published materials since the 80s. Different than old school D&D, SWN has a much simpler class system, with most of the customisation done through background, foci (i.e. feats) and a robust skill system (based on classic Traveler - which is the skill system of the Hostile game too). For SWN I can easily convert any D&D adventure (any version, easier with up to 2e), and Call of Cthulhu (d100 systems) with some small work. Additional flavour from other games are always welcomed (OSR compatible preferred, but anything can be discussed): Any rule, class, foci, etc from any OSR game can be considered. [Sine Nomine](https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/publisher/3482/Sine-Nomine-Publishing) books are very easy to integrate with each other. I have a few of them if someone is interested.

# Player Characters
## Character creation guidance

- Character creation on the SWN book, pages 3 to 25. Pre-built characters are available on page 26.
- Classes available: warrior, expert or mix/adventurer (i.e. no magic or psionic powers)
- Everyone starts at level 1 with max HP (reduces hp jump at first level).
- Character sheet: [fillable pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bM8pMgGjMKao6s-12BjnkQ9MzXhFJ8i2/view?usp=drivesdk), [Google sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19vw6EHrl_2-8BcHob2_bxvcpLnVbAHbW3StjrNEFoKg/edit#gid=1671565117) or [freebooter app](https://www.swnfreebooter.net/)

## Advancement & replacements

We will use the slower progression rules from WWN/CWN, instead of SWN's normal progression. Each session grants from 1 to 3 XP.

Replacements (upon character death or retirement) will start at level 1.

## Harm & violence

If characters reach 0 HP, they must succeed a physical save. If fail they gain a maiming wound (CWN) when they recover.

# Equipment lists

- Equipment from the SWN book is considered the standard most common equipment available.
	- We are in year 2225, which means the maximum available technology is TL4 (SWN 63)
- More specific items, such as those from Hostile books, will cost their $ value in credits, sometimes being significantly more expensive than common equipment.
	- [Hostile Setting](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fJPqFVlO9pqcjg7lMVgE9lAy4_vml6pW&usp=drive_fs) for generic equipment and base weapons (damage conversion: SWN dmg = Hostile dmg / 2)
	- [Hostile Toolkits](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fL8DRXAaHosQ6aXeTCiIC1YKSVjhVCgk&usp=drive_fs) for specific equipment (includes explosives)
	- [Hostile Gun Locker](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fKPO19H1ZY4RAQoknhycMyO8sL4MN02V&usp=drive_fs) for advanced weapons
