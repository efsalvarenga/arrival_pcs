### Advancements

Experience gain:

As per **SWN** 56.
### Mental decay

**Short term (stress)**

PC's individual (short term) stress is abstracted to a game pace mechanics: **Tension Pool**. The **Tension Pool** is managed by the GM.

**Long term (affliction)**

Long term mental decay (i.e. **Afflictions**) happens when it is narratively coherent. Long term mental decay is not a major theme of Hostile, so it will be used sparingly. The GM will ask for a Mental Save when there is a chance to develop an **Affliction** and they will be randomly rolled on the following **MMR** table.

### Physical decay

**Short term (criticals)**

Upon rolling a natural 20 on an **Attack** roll, deal damage with **3x** the normal damage dice.

**Long term (injuries)**

When PCs are **Mortally Wounded**, they suffer a serious, long lasting injury. The following table is derived from **Cities Without Number**, for thematic coherence with **Hostile**.

| d12   | Injury                                                              |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | **Gut wound**: -1 penalty to a random physical attribute modifier.  |
| 2     | **Brain damage**: -1 penalty to a random mental attribute modifier. |
| 3     | **Trauma**: Gain an affliction.                                     |
| 4     | One **eye is ruined**.                                              |
| 5-6   | Left (5) or right (6) **leg is ruined**.                            |
| 7-8   | Left (7) or right (8) **arm is ruined**.                            |
| 9-10  | **System damage**: Gain +1 permanent **System Strain**.             |
| 11-12 | **Just a flesh wound**: It's not that bad of a hit after all.       |
### Relations

Relations development will not be used for Hostile.
