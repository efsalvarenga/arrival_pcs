## Themes

**Gritty sci-fi**
> Characters are blue collar spacers, working dangerous jobs in the hostility of space. Every hazard is trying to kill characters all the time. Everything in the world that isn’t an active corporate interest is run down, decaying, and stained. Earth is a traditional cyberpunk setting, but in space there is much less "street violence", and cybernetics are generally not reliable.
> *List of hazards: lack of oxygen, vacuum, radiation, excessive cold, excessive heat, aliens, alien infections, poisonous atmosphere, high pressure atmosphere, high decompression rate and high gravity acceleration in large bodies.*

**Horror & fear**
> A cynical world, filled with everyday people going about their jobs is a common starting point for good horror stories. Humans are not alone in the universe. Alien predators have been found in multiple worlds, and sometimes even in asteroids. Advanced alien societies had their remnants found by earth explorers, but intelligent life is still to be observed. Some theorists say they have been found, and are among us. And none knows when and where aliens will be found.

**Political intrigue & treachery**
> Several factions with their own motives and goals. Everyone is out for their own interests, and they’re trustworthy only so long as their interests align with yours. Everyone assumes that deals will be kept only so long as they’re mutually profitable and relationships will only continue as long as they offer benefits to all parties
> Factions are classified in 3 groups:
> - **Technology & resourceful factions**: the strongest group, mostly formed by Mega Corporations and their subsidiaries.
> - **Belief factions**: their Influence is subtle and ideological, mostly formed by religions and conspiracy theorists
> - **Rising authoritative supra-government**: early years of an attempt of Earth governments to regain control from the Mega Corporations hands - the Terran Mandate.

## Starting hook

Advanced alien ruins were found in 2223 in the Perdurabo system. An ice sample was bought by Tharsis' Parkfield Biolabs, which contained RNA that can be used to cure early dementia caused by frequent faster than light travel. The RNA named Neuroplasticity Augmentor Sequence (NAS-RNA), however, the RNA cannot be easily replicated in laboratory. For this reason, the discovery was not made public yet, and Tharsis has been moving fast to evaluate the feasibility to establish an ice mine in the system.

If proven feasible, the existence of the Brightside Mining Station in the system is an advantage. The station is a poorly managed facility that would be easy to purchase if the exploration proves commerciality of the play (see Hostile-Setting 82, for detail on the licensing process).

Perdurabo is a system blazing with the murderous light of a red giant star. The hard-bitten miners of the Brightside Mining Station maintain the only outpost of civilisation in a system filled with lethal light and stellar outlaws. Ancient asteroid sky tombs lie in the vicinity while a seething rebellion boils beneath Brightside Station's steel skin.

### Contract

**Contract signed with Tharsis Mining General Manager for Ice Exploration John McLeod.**

You are the crew going to Perdurabo. You main goal is to execute the Exploration Framework that enables the commercial evaluation of the Ice Mine play. Non-disclosed milestones, that will be paid off books, is infiltrating and deteriorating the leadership of Brightside station, so its later acquisition is even cheaper. 

Contracted roles and milestones are detailed below. Monthly salary is Salary + Multiplier x Profession Rank. Each milestone pays a bonus of a number of times the crew monthly salary. The crew will have a LTDA company where they are the shareholders.

Basic ship maintenance & fuel is paid by shipowner, additional repairs & fuels are paid by the LTDA (discounted for contract payment).

Ship must dock for life support supplies every 6 weeks (max life support is 2 months). Work shifts are 12x12, 7 days a week. You will carry a holographic AI suitcase to speak with the GM weekly on Saturdays. Replacements (in case of sickness or indisposition) will be sent from the fastest system where they can be available.

Olaf Gustafson, born in Iceland in the year 2146 (79 yo). He is an old (but athletic) failed geologist who became a geography teacher for teenagers. He spends most of his time looking for proofs that intelligent aliens exist and they are good to us. He is sure they are the ones responsible for establishing the mega corporations and we have only to thank them for improving our world. As a kid he was (or thinks he was) abducted by Greys. And that they implanted something on him that healed him from asthma. He believes the aliens spared him for a reason. And that reason is to help the mega corporations thrive. For decades he religiously went to the gym and trained boxing. He used to be wiser, though. But now he has developed stage one Alzheimer and sometimes forgets important things, or act a bit silly or childish. During his geology studies he interned in the mega corp X where he helped them mine asteroid Y. He learned the hard work of the miners and also a bit of the managing part. After finishing his studies he continued working for corp X for 10 years as a miner. Besides the conspiracy of intelligent aliens existing, he also thinks that there exists a Galactic Confederation where aliens and humans decide the fate of the different planets.

- MadSpark is a roughneck explosive expert that studied in LA who can also fly spacecraft / drones (co-pilot in this crew?).
- He was a hardworking & intelligent student at Uni & then went to work on several mining missions. During one of these missions, he was involved in an accident where the explosives went off too early (he liked the adrenaline rush of running away & feeling the heat of the explosion on his back but this time he misjudged it…) & got hit on the head by a flying rock. After much surgery & time in hospital, he survived but since then he has had a screw loose.
- He’s obviously in mining industry work for the money but also just because he loves to “blow shit up” & gets a hard on making things explode!
- He is a practical engineer who is constantly making new gadgets. If you ask him to make something & he has the right materials / tools, he can make anything. If he’s not asked to make something useful, he will spend his time making pointless gadgets that amuse him. He has invented his own type of shotgun that can be used in space (it mixes oxygen & nitrogen in the right quantities to provide quite a kick!). 
- He finds it difficult to communicate with people & is definitely “on the spectrum”!
- Appearance: tall, lean but strong & redneck in appearance. Around 30 years old but looks older. He has no eyebrows (they keep getting burnt off in explosions!).
