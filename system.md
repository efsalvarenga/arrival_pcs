# Grip
***Humanity, Sanity and Willpower, based on [Silent Legion's Madness](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CexCpDNKNSMNnkGgDNrVne1gG-03L5dm&usp=drive_fs)***

*Bloodshed, exposure to horror and pushing oneself to accomplish feats humans would have failed can break havoc in the minds of mundane creatures, consuming their **Grip**. The best that most sufferers can do is to accept a **Delirium**, creating a zone of scorched reason to serve as a buffer against the awareness of the cruel and impossible.*

## Grip score

The **Grip** maximum score is set as the **average between Intelligence and Wisdom, multiplied by 5 - respecting a minimum of 50 and maximum of 90**. If the current **Grip** ever reaches 0 the character is hopelessly lost in their own tormented perceptions and can no longer function as a player character.

## Grip checks, and loosing grip

Once per scene, the GM might require PCs to make a **Grip** check: a d100 roll under the current **Grip** score. On a failure the PC looses **Grip** as per table below. The check might be triggered by bloodshed or horror events. Alternatively, the player can choose to expend 1d4 **Grip** to re-roll a failed attribute, skill, attack or saving throw check. In a single scene, a character can lose no more **Grip** score than the (non cumulative) maximum result of the worst shock they confront.

## Deliria, and recovering Grip

**Players might choose to accept a Delirium** for their characters to recover **Grip**. The player can choose what delirium they get (see material below) or roll randomly in a chosen table. It is easier to choose the new Delirium in-between sessions, and discuss the roleplay and mechanical results with the GM.

**Deliria examples and references (non comprehensive)**

- 3.5e SRD variant indefinite insanity [table 6-11](https://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/campaigns/sanity.htm)

- Best Left Buried's [afflictions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gMvMcuhIFXWkvjqnP8e-XpcMVObmRVrY/view) (zine 5)

After taking the Delirum the player **rolls 1d20; if the roll is equal or greater than their total number of Deliria** then the newfound structure and rationalisation soothes their mind, **recovering 10 Grip**. If the roll is less than their total number of Deliria, then the fresh insanity just makes everything worse, and 10 points of sanity are lost. Once accrued, Deliria can never be lost.

Some Deliria come with phobias and compulsions. A PC can resist the phobia or compulsion by making a successful **Grip** Check. On a failure, he or she must obey the Delirium unless they are willing to lose 1d6 **Grip** for defying the structure they have fashioned.
